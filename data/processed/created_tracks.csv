it's just so easy to think you're broken & evil

it's like 
i lived my whole life thinking i didn't have a soul 
and... 
ok sorry 
i promise i'm going somewhere with this 
it's just, 
i didn't even know i was fucked up! 
i didn't even know what i was going thru 
until like, a year ago 
and now it's everything 
this place is designed to kill us 
and make us think it's our fault 
sorry, sorry this is all super obvious 
it's just 
i'm glad we're in the struggle together 
but 
i wish 
we didn't have to define ourselves 
by the struggle

Although companies are required to report on the broader impact of their business, there are no clearly defined standards for doing so, and the level of audit assurance is typically lower.

Governments, however, increasingly recognise that the role of the private sector in getting to net-zero can only be properly evaluated if there is a more standardised approach to non-financial reporting. Moves towards more structured disclosure around people, the planet and purpose could, however, bring materiality risks.

How do you manage all this if you are sitting in a corporate? Does it have to create an army of metrics trackers and verifiers? How do you ensure compliance across different countries and through your supply chain? Will those countries get together to create common reporting standards?

Some are encountering significant complexity in customs clearances and border procedures and while these will add to the complexity and cost of trade in the future, we would expect these process issues to calm down over time.

More serious for the long term is the impact of the rules of origin regime. This is not something that companies can navigate their way round, or learn, as with customs processes. If the effect of rules of origin through your supply chain is that your product attracts tariffs, you will either have to pay the tariffs or change your supply chain. This is particularly the case for supply chains that cross the EU-UK border during the production process ‚Äì the fact that you have sourced your components or ingredients into the UK from inside the EU does not mean that they necessarily count as EU origin when the rules are applied to their re-export back to the EU.

With their ‚ÄúEyes Wide Open‚Äù approach to advising on deals, they took a look into next year and offered their perspective on some of the key trends and factors that will be instrumental in determining whether future value is to be delivered once the deals have been done.

These are open for consultation, but once approved, organisations will have a one-year grace period to implement the new SCCs, if they rely on them for transfers. The new SCCs update the current clauses, which were not amended for the GDPR, and will allow for a range of transfer scenarios (including those between processors and from processors to controllers) and importer/exporters in and outside of the EEA. However, with so much going on ‚Äì with the end of the Brexit transition period (with no deal as yet between the UK and the EU) and the need to assess transfers and SCCs following Schrems II, combined with the possible impact of the recent CJEU Judgement on UK mass surveillance powers, when is the right time to update them?

A simple arithmetical extraction from a risk matrix can leave the impression of overspending on a remote contingency when it does not materialize, and woeful lack of preparation and mitigation when it does. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on business has underlined this acute dichotomy ‚Äì some businesses had a reference to pandemics in their risk register, others did not, but could point to vaguer formulations, which gave them some declaratory cover. How many businesses had genuinely prepared for a once-in-a-century disruption on the scale we have seen?

Looking forward, how should boards and executive teams think about external risk? Can arithmetical extrapolations of probability against impact be used to allocate resource to mitigating risk? In the UK, the FRC‚Äôs Governance Code requires a robust assessment of the company‚Äôs principal risks. However, how can a board assess the risk that an extraneous event will cause the government to shut down large parts of the economy? How useful is the concept of risk appetite for assessing macro risks? Should a company‚Äôs risk register focus on the risks for which the company can effectively mitigate the impact or affect the incidence? How useful in assessing a company as a going concern are references in risk registers to pandemics, elections, etc.?

The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020, and on 31 December 2020, the transitional period will come to an end, meaning that the EU REACH Regulation will no longer apply in the UK. Given the complex and cross-border nature of chemical supply chains, and the supply chain approach adopted in the REACH Regulation, this has major implications for anyone supplying chemicals into the EU or the UK from 2021, as well as those further down the supply chain who are buying and using chemicals.

In this session, our UK-based regulatory experts discuss the effect of Brexit on the REACH Regulation, both in the UK and the EU, and the key features of the new ‚ÄúUK REACH‚Äù system that is likely to apply in the UK from 2021. Whether you are a manufacturer, an importer or a distributor of chemical products, we explore the critical regulatory steps you will need to take in trading with the UK or the EU to ensure you can continue to do so, including practical examples and case studies.

Das Dark Horse unter den Schweizer House-Produzenten.

Vor einiger Zeit schrieb mir ein H√∂rer, um sich f√ºr die gespielte Musik zu bedanken.Er nannte sich Son Ami. Da er mir aber nichts unterbreiten wollte, dachte ich es handle sich lediglich um einen sympathischen Typen, dem die Musik gef√§llt. Dabei hat er es faustdick hinter den Ohren.

Erst nach einer Weile schickte er mir kommentarlos einen Downloadlink. Die Tracks sind bis heute noch fixer Bestandteil des CH Beats-Repertoires. Generell scheint er nicht gross mit seiner Musik angeben zu wollen. Auf den g√§ngigen Portalen wie Soundcloud, MX3.ch etc. beschr√§nkt sich sein Infotext auf den Wohnort Luzern und seine T√§tigkeit als DJ und Produzent.

Heute wird er zur Angeberei gezwungen: Wir sprechen n√§mlich √ºber seine Mutter die mit Francine Jordi im selben Chor war (ok, das z√§hlt wohl weniger als Angeberei). √úber seinen Vater, der schon damals DJ war und seine Zeit in Paris. Dort war er bei der grossen game Entwickler Firma Ubisoft als Projekt Manager angestellt und arbeitete mit Pers√∂nlichkeiten aus der Filmindustrie in Hollywood.

Ach und wen wunderts: Er hat noch etwa ein Dutzend unver√∂ffentlichte Tracks im K√∂cher. Die stellt er euch in seinem DJset vor.

https://soundcloud.com/rollover401ktogoldira

Before you can rollover a Rollover 401k into a Gold IRA, you need to determine what the difference is between a Rollover 401k and a Rollover IRA. Many people think that a Rollover IRA is a certain type of Retirement account, like a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. This is not true.

https://soundcloud.com/rollover401ktogoldira/sets/tradinggator-rollover-401k

A Rollover IRA is a common variation of a retirement account, which is designed to take a portion of your regular income and contribute it to your retirement funds. It is one of the newer types of retirement accounts that are designed to be very flexible, so that they can be used as a source of funds for retirement purposes.

Although a Rollover IRA is a retirement plan, it is not the same as a traditional retirement plan. The traditional IRA was created by Congress, as a way for individuals to save for their future. You contribute some of your regular income into the retirement account, and you are allowed to withdraw some or all of your money at any time, without penalty.

The primary difference between a Rollover IRA and a Rollover 401k, is that the Rollover IRA does not tax your earnings. This is why it is very popular with employers. If you have any money that you earn during the year, you are able to take that money out tax-free.

A Roth IRA does not allow the same flexibility as a Rollover IRA, because the Roth IRA allows contributions to be made on a pre-tax basis. In other words, if you earn money in the regular course of your business, you are able to take that money out tax-free, and use it for your retirement.

As an example, let's say that you made a contribution to a Roth IRA and you have enough money left over, you are able to rollover that money into a Gold IRA. When you do this, you are also saving the IRS the headaches of figuring out how much income you should be putting into your retirement account, every year.

Another advantage of a Rollover 401k to a Gold IRA is that you are not locked into a certain number of dollars for years to come. You can rollover into a Rollover IRA as often as you want, as long as the money is not withdrawn from the account.

But, there is a problem with a Rollover 401k to a Gold IRA. Unlike a traditional IRA, there is no guarantee that you will get money from the Rollover IRA in future years.

And when you rollover into a Rollover IRA, you are not likely to get any of your money back. Although you are allowed to withdraw some of your money tax-free, once you have withdrawn it, you cannot get more money.

The trick is to avoid getting into a Rollover 401k to a Rollover IRA at all. You should also make sure that you are able to get a certain amount of money back, because, with a Rollover IRA, you are essentially gambling with your future income.

If you want to get the most benefit out of your Rollover 401k to a Gold IRA, then you should try to avoid getting into a Rollover 401k to a Rollover IRA. If you need to rollover the entire Rollover 401k into a Gold IRA, then you can do so at any time, but be sure to consult with a professional financial planner before you do so.

803656114,781686340,True,1.0,2020-04-21 07:44:42+00:00,"Here's a quick review of how rollover IRA (RIA) annuities works. This may help clarify the IRS definition of RIA for those who are not familiar with this type of rollover arrangement.

https://soundcloud.com/rollover401ktogoldira

Rollover. In the law, the term ""rollover"" means the continuous transfer of assets from one account to another. In the annuity world, the term ""roll"" means transferring your stock or bond funds from your non-deductible taxable account to a rollover account (often called ""rolling""rollover"") in which you can include qualified RIA income.

https://soundcloud.com/rollover401ktogoldira/sets/tradinggator-rollover-401k

Old assets. In the case of an annuity, your ""old assets"" are anything that is not protected by tax shelters such as rental losses, losses from short sales, and tax-deferred withdrawals. These types of losses cannot be deducted or depreciated.

Assets included in your account. These are typically the funds in your annuity plan's account, excluding the rollover account.

Protection. The ""protection"" in an annuity is the tax deferral. And you can also have a rollover that provides tax protection. There are typically both federal and state tax deferred portions of the annuity rollover.

Roll over the minimum required amount. Many annuities provide a certain minimum amount of investment protection before they must be rolled over. In addition, the annuity must be purchased and closed in the account before it can be rolled over.

Investment protection. The original funds in the annuity should not be withdrawn until the proceeds are used. Withdrawals can occur at any time, but only if you are covered by the withdrawal protection provided by the original product.

Tax deferral. Usually, the annuity will provide either federal or state tax deferred portions of the rollover. If these portions of the rollover do not qualify for tax deferral, a separate rollover IRA (RIA) is provided.

Because of this important distinction, there are several types of annuities. There are also some very specific differences between these. It is best to consult with an experienced investor, such as an IRA custodian, if you have questions regarding any of the types of annuities discussed here.

It is important to understand that a Roth IRA is different from a rollover IRA. When you roll over your non-deductible IRA to a Roth IRA, you are not making a nondeductible contribution to a Roth IRA. You are instead making a nondeductible contribution to your traditional IRA. And you must take and pay taxes on your contribution before you can take your distributions from your traditional IRA.

The basic difference between the two types of rollovers is that a rollover is a name for an already-established arrangement where the IRS allows individuals to convert their entire portfolio into one type of traditional IRA. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, is a new type of retirement account, which has only recently been created and will not allow participants to convert their entire portfolios into it. It is also a relatively new form of retirement account, so people who have substantial amounts of investments in it are more likely to require a Roth IRA custodian.

While the terminology is slightly different, the basic terms and structure of a rollover IRA are very similar to a Roth IRA. Generally, a rollover takes place when the remaining balance of a non-deductible IRA is transferred to a Roth IRA. The income tax deferred portion of the Roth IRA is also usually taken as income tax deferred contributions to the traditional IRA.

803654881,781686340,True,1.0,2020-04-21 07:41:01+00:00,"A rollover from a pension into a retirement plan is a great way to save money on your money for retirement. There are many benefits to a 401k rollover. Here are just a few of them.

https://soundcloud.com/rollover401ktogoldira

In a pension plan, you make contributions to your savings account and receive a certain amount of money each month. If you decide to change jobs or retire early, your contributions are still going to the pension plan. That's why it's so important to make sure your pension has a dependable provider.

https://soundcloud.com/rollover401ktogoldira/sets/tradinggator-rollover-401k

Many people choose to move their pension into an IRA or 401k because they're sure that it will be able to provide a bigger retirement nest egg for them. They also want to save on taxes. Another important benefit is that they can invest their pension money as well as their own money.

If you're already retired or thinking about retiring soon, your pension may have been put in a rollover IRA. This means that it will be transferred into your new retirement plan. The first step is to open a new account. It might be a 401k or a traditional IRA.

After you've figured out which type of account you'd like to use, you need to figure out the amount of money you need to put in your retirement plan. Your new provider will give you instructions on how much you need to contribute each month.

Before you do anything else, you need to talk to your new provider and discuss your situation. Let them know what your pension is worth to you.

When you rollover 401k to a gold IRA, you make one large contribution and then the rest is paid out every month. You make smaller contributions throughout the year until your account is maxed out.

Gold IRA accounts are good for saving because they don't have fees associated with them. They are also tax free. Their benefits aren't the same as your traditional IRA.

A major advantage to saving for retirement through a 401k rollover is that your pension is insured by the government. It's a safe haven for your retirement money. It is also the safest investment option there is.

Most states in Arizona are set up so that people with pensions will be able to choose one of these accounts for you. Your tax advisor can help you figure out the right benefits for your situation.

Rollover 401k are becoming more popular because many of us want to have a good retirement. They are very easy to use, are tax free, and will give you the income you need when you retire.

So it's important to make sure you take the time to research all of your retirement and investment opportunities. If you're not sure where to start, get online and do some shopping around for a company that will match your financial needs.
