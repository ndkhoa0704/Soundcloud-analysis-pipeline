As innovative as the technologies he uses, in love with experimenting and having never enough of it, Andreino is a dj, a producer, an artist.

transferring to the dance floor the million possibilities that the latest arrangement softwares offer: new and stunning melodies that are enriched by vibrant and hypnotic effects.

► Booking  & General Inquiries |  andy@alignrecords.com

Following the success of his most recent releases, including the hit single “Get On Up!” peaking at #6 on the official ARIA Australian Charts, the full stack recording artist, writer, producer, label owner is gearing up for a string of new releases – celebrating two decades since his debut “DISH” on Virgin Records.

A proud Filipino, Andy Roda was born in Copenhagen, graduated in New York City, now living in Berlin. Classically trained, he is a musician equally comfortable in jazz, soul, r’n’b – with roots in gospel, as singing weekly in his local church, was the nurturing ground during his childhood.

As a writer, Roda constructs his lyric accompanied dance [house] music in a traditional manner, and his versatile skills puts him in full control of his musical and visual output, mastering both music arrangement, production, and visual editing.

Since 2018 he has toured as a singer, dancer, actor in the hit show “BEAT IT” – a pop theatre musical based the life of the “King Of Pop” Michael Jackson across Europe, serving the role as “Acting Captain”, and substitute to “young Michael’.

The previous year he joined a star studded Danish cast in the theatre production of Susanne Bier’s Oscar nominated movie “Efter Brylluppet” (After The Wedding), directed by Peter Langdal.

Aside from his solo releases and theatre work, notable mentions are his tours as lead vocalist for platinum selling Danish Act Safri Duo, competing as the pioneering Filipino artist in the Eurovision Song Contest with his own song “Love Is Love”, as well as in Ed McMahon’s “Next Big Star” on American Television. He has opened for the Backstreet Boys, Spice Girls’ Emma Bunton, as well as written music for Asian boybands Mr. Tiger and S9F, and Philippines’ “Ultimate Showgirl” Vina Morales.

An advocate for his local communities, Roda co-founded the P-NOiSE Festival (A cultural exchange of Filipino Arts, Music, Dance and Film), which was mentioned in CNN, and has taken place across Copenhagen, Paris and Manila, supporting local and International artists.

With releases on Virgin Records, SONY, Kontor Records, as well as credible house music labels including Kingstreet, Simma Black, Tinted, Ibadan, Blacksoul, Milk & Sugar, Andy Roda continues to soar to new heights with his own label, ALIGN Records.

Their records ""Affenstunde"" (1971) and ""In den Gärten Pharaos"" (1972), played with the Moog III Synthesizer, are claimed to be fundamentally influencing works in Electronica. They went down in the annals of German film music history with their soundtracks for legendary cinema classics like ""Aguirre"", ""Fitzcarraldo"", ""Nosfeartu"" and ""Cobra Verde"" by German film director Werner Herzog. 

In the light of a current rediscovery of the 1970s Ambient- Electronica and German Progressive Rock movement featuring bands like Kraftwerk, Can, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze or Harmonia, Popol Vuh is now the 2nd band, being remixed by today´s Electronica avant-garde, including treats by Stereolab, Mouse on Mars, Peter Kruder (Kruder & Dorfmeister), Thomas Fehlmann (The Orb), Moritz von Oswald, A Critical Mass, Alex Barck (Jazzanova), Roland Appel, Mika Vainio (Pan Sonic), and Haswell & Hecker.

""Let the Music Move You . . .""

For over 30 years UNCLE DOG has been djaying and producing records in europe and around the world. Born and raised in London he was surrounded from an early age by every type of musical influence appealing to his hightened sensitivity.
As the house movement was born in europe Filippo was already djaying with pioneers such as Paul Anderson, Dave Dorrell, C.J. Mackintosh, Danny Rampling and Paul Oakenfold in the capital's underground ""temples"", Heaven, The Wag, Cafe de Paris, Enter the Dragon, Subterrania, Westworld, Sunrise, Future and even in MK's and the Sound Factory in New York and Pacia in Ibiza, Sharm el Sheik, Barcelona and Madrid.  He produced records for Virgin 10, Phonogram and FFRR under the name of The Universal Funk Industry and Love Inc.
In the early nineties he became jaded by the overcommercialisation of the underground house scene which he so loved and decided to move to Italy where he layed low until the new millenium when he decided to start djaying and producing again.

He works as a dj in Italy and Spain appreciated for his respect of quality dance music and his understanding of the underground music scene.  
His DJ sets ar transmitted regularly on Radio DeeJay, the most famous radio station in italy.

Since then, she ha been on a constantly evolving musical journey. In the early years, her sound was rooted in techno and landed most often on the label Brouqade Records, which she established in 2007. The label is still running too, and celebrated its 10th Year Birthday Celebration entitled 'Past/Present/Future' that emphatically encapsulated all that's great about the label. 
Aside from Brouqade, Dana's music has also featured on the liked of Autoreply, Work Them Records, Howl and Underground Quality. It was Jus Ed's label where she released her stunning debut album. 'Naturally' in 2014, an LP that introduced Dana to a whole new audience and showcased her pure house sound with some distinctions. In 2017 she started her new Label 'Cave Recordings' that showcased her wide musical range mainly rooted in House with old school flavor. 
When she isn't busy in the studio crafting textured tracks, Dana is a fine DJ who holds down resident duties at top Berlin space, Club der Visionaere. It is there that she lays down seductive tracks from the worlds of house and techno as well as gems in between. Aside from her beloved CDV, Dana has played in some of the globe's foremost house and techno nightclubs, often alongside some of the scene's prime movers and shakers.

Most of us come under the spell of the electronic cosmos sooner or later, but doing so at the tender age of 4 years rather seems highly exceptional. And even if this might appear almost impossible at first glance, this was indeed the case for young Christoph alias Click | Click, when he heard Kraftwerk for the very first time on the radio back then. Therefore, it is no surprise that this experience was going to change his life significantly.

His name thereby originates from his earliest musical roots when he was still forfeited to the more minimal sounds of Techno and in which time he also started his first own label Kassette Records in the year 2006. And even if much has happened since and a lot changed musically, Click | Click always remained true to his roots by keeping his name. Through his musical transformation from Minimal Techno to Jackin' House, also the labels changed in the course of time, on which we have been able to pursue his musical talent over the years.

In 2013, he already established his second labels Palms & Flamingos, meant to provide room for exactly such projects, which had developed over the years. Of course it did not take long, until many reputable labels of the scene got wind of his artistic refinement. Like this, Click | Click already put out numerous releases on imprints like Green Velvet/ Cajmere's Cajual, Shir Khan's Exploited Ghetto, Mihalis Safras' Label Mr. Carter/ Material and Riva Starr's Snatch! Records, which not only lead to countless chart positions on relevant platforms, but also caused further international interest in his music.

BIO:
Gioele Giacopelli as JWL is an Italian DJ and producer. He began to love music since he was only a kid, thanks to the domestic environment. His 360 degrees musical groundwork has been settled first by his parents (dad is a bass player and mum a great singer) who introduced him to artists such as Stevie Wonder, Pino Daniele and others from the 70’s and 80’s. When he started “walking with his own legs” and so creating a proper knowledge of different musical genres and artists, JWL discovered to have a big feeling for the Afro-American music culture (Soul, R’n’B, Funk, Jazz, Hip Hop, and so on) losing himself into the local hip hop scene. 2000 marks the first JWL's approach to the dance culture: he began to listen to some Masters At Work's productions and he was delighted about that sonority called House. Afterward, he bought his first console and started to collect vinyl records. In the following years, Gioele enriched his dance culture attending constantly at Red Zone Club in Perugia and it was fundamental for his growth. In 2005 he setted up his own studio and started producing music, gradually stepping in the Perugia underground scene, supported by various DJ's, among which Ricky L and Sauro Cosimetti. 2011 marks for JWL his first digital release of his track “Hot Love” on the American label ""Plus Plus"". In September of 2012 he remixed Double Beat's track ""The Sense Of Truth"", released on ""Soul Shift Music"". After that, he made a track called “The Whistle Track” released on “The Yellow Drumachine EP” (Adult Dance Music) and in February of 2013 he made a remix of Joy Lee and Speakdeep's track ""Geist"", out on “Mind Your Hate”. JWL’s remix of Joy Lee’s track “On The Road”, released in November 2013 on “Sexonwax”, has preceded the turning point in his career, his first vinyl release on the Umbria-based label “Fortezza Records” with a track called “Little Theme”. This track, belongs to a banging four tracker EP featuring artists such as Mass Prod and Rufus, Giovanni Ferretti and Speakdeep. This EP was supported by a lot of Italian and international artists, for instance Mister G and Boyd Jarvis. In June 2015, JWL signed another important vinyl release on the UK label “Phatway Traxx”. This EP named “The Disco Cuts EP”, was first in many charts and the JWL’s track “Again’n’Again, contained on the b-side, it was supported by big artists like Ben Ufo. In 2016, he became part of the Berlin-based label “Soundscapes Records/Escape Series” and signed a four tracker EP in collaboration with the Tuscany musician and producer “INNO”. This amazing EP will be released on vinyl in the next months. JWL has performed in many important clubs such as “KaterBlau” (Berlin), “Red Zone Club/B-Side” (Perugia), “Serendipity/Rec Room“ (Foligno), “DOT Club” and important festivals as “Collective”, “SoundOf”, “Terni Factory”, “Interleave” and so on.

In the ‘90s, Holder began producing his own tracks and released 12”s for a number of labels like Definitive, Stickmen, his own imprint DNH, and !K7 (which released his first two full-length albums One Night in the Disco, and Back On Track).  Furthermore, Holder released many of his productions through NRK Sound Division, including many of his biggest hits such as ""I Once Believed in U"", ""Trying to Find Myself"" and ”Da Sambafrique"", in addition to full-length efforts From Within, Underground Alternatives, and The Other Side. 

Upcoming in 2016, look out for numerous releases on his label DNH under both Holder’s own name, as well as his Trackheadz alias.  Nick has also recently launched his own radio show DEEP SECTION, which is broadcast every Wednesday night at 8-10pm EST on VIBE 105.5 in Toronto and online at www.vibe1055.com.

About me:
    i just got this lovely message from one of my true faith listeners which pretty much sums up what it's all about in a few words. no further info needed. Thanks, Evelyn

    ""I think that there are some DJ that just spin music like they are alone in their rooms,
    never taking the time to take a moment and share the real feeling of what good music is.
    For those kind of DJ's music is about ego. But then their are DJ like you, who hear good music
    and want to share it among friends. A great DJ hears a good tune and wants to run around and tell
    the world how great it is. For me your show is more about bringing all listeners together in a world
    groove. Thank you Mr Rutten for shinning your brilliant light to my and everyone of your listeners worlds :)""

It all started in the summer of ‘89 when he landed in Tenerife on vacation and stumbled across the delights of the emerging sounds of Chicago and Acid House. Returning to the UK, he immediately went in search of this new found music, a pair of turntables were bought and with it a musical career was born.

He started on the wheels of steel at the age of nine, and certainly made a contribution on the House scene in Chicago. He performed with some of Chicago’s luminaries, such as Armando, Ron Carroll, Boo Williams, Paul Johnson, Andre Harris, Mark Grant, and Glenn Underground, just to name a few. Inspired by Chicago’s definition of House, he accumulated his own unique style. DJ Fritz can move the crowd in more ways than one, as he strives to make more and more music. DJ Fritz has consistently played at some of Chicago’s infamous old and new school underground clubs. Having been a part of the House scene for over two decades, DJ Fritz has mastered the art of DJ’ing locally and internationally. 
As a producer, DJ Fritz produced his own tracks and remixed old school favorites like “Love You More” by Genuine, “New Day” by Patti LaBelle, and “O” by Omarion. In 2000, DJ Fritz created Muzic Vision Records with DJ Papa, with the following mission: to create, produce, remix, and play unique music that combines jazz, gospel, house, lounge, and other soulful qualities. With this in mind, Muzic Vision Records released “African Orchestra,” “Brighter Day,” and “The Journey Home” with last releases from Glenn Underground titled “Inner Techno” and “Ambient Jazz 1.” Muzic Vision Records established itself, and DJ Fritz continued to work on projects, and spinning at major nightclubs. He then moved on and collaborated with DJ Pap to form Naked Soul, which released nothing but soulful grooves. Later, more entities were created, such as Black Mamba, which is their African tribal grooves, and Gamma Kids, where you will hear more of the techno beats. 
DJ Fritz’s music, producing, and remixing styles reflect the deep sounds of the soulful House in Chicago. He has a number of singles and EPs supported by Citrus Recording and Cameo Recording in the UK, Lad Records in Portugal, United Music Records in France, Music Plan Records in Italy, and his own label, Muzic Vision Records. DJ Fritz creates and produces sounds that blur the lines between genres and connect the dots for his listeners. He is still highly involved within the House scene in Chicago and is currently, working on several tracks, which will soon be released.

Nestling somewhere between the sideways slant of a sepia Sunday morning and the electrostatic seduction of a Saturday night, Tim has carved out a cultural niche that is his, and his alone. His original productions range from the jaw-droppingly original (It’s a Fine Line – Woman), to the heartbreakingly sublime (Tim Paris – Outback, Stones & Vinyl), and his remixes (the XX; Silicone Soul; Salif Keita; Telepop Musik) reflect his unique musical position.  Tim’s label, Marketing Music, has quietly gone about releasing some of the most innovative and gloriously confounding electronic house music of the past decade, and his collaboration with ex Black Strobe bohemian Ivan Smagghe, It’s a Fine Line, has borne fruit, after juicy fruit. Dancers, his first full-length release, was signed by Canadian label My Favorite Robot and is an astonishing piece of work. Switching effortlessly from metallic electro purring, to slack-jawed new-wave disco, to shimmering, bewitching, house, it marks a new high point in a career rammed full of them.",8762,254,tim,tim paris,0,939,user,2022-02-18T16:20:50Z,paris,173,10,tim-paris,https://soundcloud.com/tim-paris,5,,66,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/939,soundcloud:users:939,Tim Paris,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:939,artist-stations:939,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,soundcloud:users:939,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:955087', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000000939-9KKUwU-original.jpg'}]",

From the outset, his early productions on Hypercolour UTTU and Ultramajic showed incredible depth and dance floor sensibilities, frequently mastering that difficult line between genres that producers seek, but often fall short of (and often sounding contrived when trying). His vinyl-only label series “Bodytrax” (which he proudly runs with the Clone.nl crew in Holland) is an ongoing outlet for these productions; one that ebbs and flows through his passion for creating what he feels like organically and not what’s being hyped at the time. Drawing on his years of experience as a DJ and not being one to settle simply for “getting the job done”, his output is renowned for being incredibly effective and standing out in the sets of DJs the world over, with his music consistently featured on Radio 1 shows and essential mixes. In 2016, he dropped his critically “Cobra Effect EP” on DEXT which was championed by the likes of Black Madonna and Jackmaster, which led to an invitation by legendary pioneers Leftfield to remix ""Song Of Life"" on their historic 22 Year Anniversary re-release of “Leftism” in 2017. He also explored collaborations including “Hotshot” with long-time supporter Paul Woolford aka Special Request, and his new “Duel Series” which kicked off in late 2019 with Berlin legend Fiedel.

On the performance side, his early days saw him as a DMC DJ Championship competitor, and then cutting his teeth worldwide as a techno DJ (including a residency at the UK's largest and most respected parties “Atomic Jam” in Birmingham). His lifelong obsession with seeking out and collecting music has also paid off in spades in the form of his vast record collection, which he explores with mixes and shows he has produced for the likes of Radio 1, FACT, Mixmag, DJ Mag, and Rinse FM. Armed with these experiences and credentials, he is known as a technically skilled and incredibly intuitive DJ, taking risks where they count and never playing the same set twice. Tapping into his love affair with music and working the floor, he prides himself in being able to play pretty much anywhere, be it techno, electro & EBM in the main rooms of Berghain or Fabric, jacking Chicago and acid house alongside the originators in the “Dancemania Mixmag Lab”, or electronica & beyond supporting Leftfield on their Leftism 22 UK arena UK arena tour in 2017.

These were the years of the “new wave” / “electro funk” / “garage” / “house” of the 90s, and Alex quickly became well known across the leading clubs across the globe.
Alongside his DJing successes, he melted efforts with his business partner Marco Baroni to build the brand Kamasutra with releases that were felt on a global scale.
In 1999 Planet Funk were born and with their first single “Chase the Sun” they emerged at the top of global charts, and subsequently various albums and singles of equal success and industry acclaim. The band has released a total of 5 albums plus a “Best Of” and is currently releasing its sixth album.
Alex Neri has collaborated with the notable Tenax Club in Florence in starting the record label “Tenax Recordings”, acclaimed both by the public and the music industry. The first single, “Housetrack”, released in 2004 won the Siae prize for being the most sold album from an independent label.
Tenax Recordings has showcased a myriad of well known DJs and Italian producers like Federico Grazzini, Ilario Alicante, Luca Bacchetti, Philipp&Cole and many more.
While Alex continues to produce, he also works on various remixing projects for many international and local artists.
At the very core, Alex’s passion remains the club, where he can best express his pure love for music.

Empro und Sven sind zwei Prachtexemplare, die sich vor nicht all zu langer Zeit erst gefunden haben. Empro ist DJ und unterhält einige einschlägige Tanzveranstaltungen, wie die Home-Sweet-Home-Party in Berlin und den Sleepless-Floor auf dem Melt!-Festival. Sven äugt dagegen virtuos und leidenschaftlich durch sein Ableton-Arrangement-Fenster und kann sich das Auflegen deswegen schon nicht verkneifen. Gott sei Dank, dass er das auch sehr gut beherrscht. Beide sind sich wohl in einem Bar25-Sommer näher gekommen, während gemeinsamen Marathon-DJ-Sets und beim sich gegenseitig Konfetti in die Unterhosen stecken. Dabei muss ihnen die kongeniale Sonne aufgegangen sein, die das Produkt „Empro & Jozwiak“ so erfreulich gedeihen lässt. Soundfreak Sven pflanzt hier ertragreiche Drum-Machines in Empros fruchtbaren Studiokompost, dessen Zentrum sich mit seismographisch nachvollziehbaren Basswellen über den Prenzlauer Berg erhebt und im anliegenden Upon-You-Büro für freundlich schielende Gesichter sorgt. Fleißige Geistesschwaden verhängen hier die Tageszeiten, Subfrequenzen drehen die Neonröhren aus der Fassung und am Ende kommt bei den beiden dann ein neues Liedchen raus.

The earliest origin of rhythmic drum objects and talking drums of the motherland, to the brand new long player from Vienna’s finest electronic drum ensemble Makossa and Megablast. Welcome to ‘Soy Como Soy’.
In 2007 the duo along with a host of talented singers and musicians created quite a stir with their debut album ‘Kunuaka’, on G-Stone recordings, receiving high praise from musical luminaries such as Gilles Peterson, Carl Craig and Laurent Garnier.  Everybody mentioned that the production sounds were tight, precise and sharply exact. DJ’s couldn’t get enough of ‘Kunuaka’. Even more so, taking it to the stage on too many festivals to mention they cemented a formidable following and fan base. Along on the ride on these live tours came the very vocalists and percussionists that appeared on the album. It is one of the main sensations from the new album ‘Soy Como Soy’ and its predecessor ‘Kunuaka’ is the fact that ‘live’ means ‘live’, the flow, the origin from the primordial drumbeat and vocalists participating with the drum.  It is like a heartbeat, quite unique.
That was then, this is now…
So the good times on the beach festivals and the worldly travelling has to come to a stop! Time to return to the Luv Lite studies in Vienna to get down to the ‘nitty gritty’ of classic retro analogue knob twiddling! Finding the freshest and most innovative musicians and vocalists, and ‘getting it down’ is a pain-staking venture at best. 
Those days and those travels of playing in front of 30,000 happy smiley people on a beach come into play though (thankfully). Experiences, states and situations, the emotions and the sensations of the last four years! Well, Makossa and Megablast do a fantastic job of applying them to ‘Soy Como Soy’. The guys have come home, and are better for it. Sounds are even tighter, more precise and exact. Vocalists illuminate the scenes and the songs.  From the massive anthem beat driven ‘Soy Como Soy’ picked up by the big dicks in just about every dance orientated genre to the beautiful tranquillity and quietude of ‘Love You’, the album indefinitely goes forth. You can definitely hear that the guys have done some serious travelling and met some fine folks along the way. Tracks like ‘If I U Me’ and  ‘Release The Pressure’ ooze with layers of emotion and mood of reflection. The climate changes with the magnificent ex ‘Tower Of Power’ singer Hubert Tubbs on two stunning tracks ‘Coming Home’ and ‘Peace’. You feel his guts when he sings, seriously, his voice is imposing and beyond the norm. OG Spiritual Godess from Zimbabwe and Cleydys Villalon from Cuba make sure the girls get their say too with somewhat strikingly exotic vocals. ‘Imimi’ and ‘Bailalo’ two tracks for me that rouse and quicken the senses with much exhilaration and gladdening. You can tell that Megablast works closely with the vocalists directly in the studio. The interaction of the human elements is firm and resolute and always convincing. These are not vocal parts sent over Internet, they are direct in the presence of the production team in the Luv Lite lounge and studios. Overseen too by Makossa’s more than keen ear, having the ability to recognize and draw the fine distinctions in sound, he is indeed the acute observer.
Suspenseful trippy analog synths and other tinted sounds, the scrupulous drums, percussion and forceful basslines, all nicely inconspicuous from their travels and their tales. A real a fusion of organic Afro-Latin beats.
Makossa and Megablast have come home finally, we missed them very much. We’re very happy to have them back. (Alan Brown, Soul Seduction, Vienna)

I started producing music on an Ensoniq EPS Sampler in my teens by sampling sounds to create my own sounds and had so much fun on that syth/ sampler. Then later moved to the computer world of using Logic and later Abeton Live which I use as my main studio software. My main instrument of choice is keyboards/ piano which is where it started back when I was 3 and what I use for my midi recording. Yet I have also been a past metal and grunge guitar extraordinaire, okay not exactly, but that's what some kids at school used to say, so I'm going with it! And been known to surprise peeps with my drumming skills. 

I've also been DJing for a darn long time when Turntables were the only option, so I prefer the real vinyl feel of DJing music where possible and use Traktor Scratch Pro so I can play any tune using timecode vinyls which feel so darn real, yet also DJ with CDJs and USB set ups and using Traktor. I've DJed at clubs, radio stations, Raves, underground events, Conventions and house parties which happen to be my fav events to play at cos they are smaller and fun and often such like minded people where the funniest stuff happens and if the floor boards are making your turntables jump from all the happy dancing, everyone thinks it's part of the set. ;)

I have created music for software, video games, DJ mixes and various other media. I have a dream of making music for animation as in something you would see on tv, on Netflix or something bigger than You Tube. Must make that happen!",86,6,Rachael,Rachael Prins,0,1069,user,2020-09-03T07:05:17Z,Prins,2,0,jemgirl,https://soundcloud.com/jemgirl,0,,28,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/1069,soundcloud:users:1069,jemgirl,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:1069,artist-stations:1069,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:1069,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:108513234', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000001069-wnDoEv-original.jpg'}]",

Solomon isn’t your everyday magician. He doesn’t know how to pull a white rabbit out of a hat or your 6 of Clubs from the deck. But what the Bay Area-based music wizard can do is ELEVATE you on the dance floor. This was clear from the time of his first gig in ’89, when he used nothing more than a tape deck and cd player to transform a middle school prom into a raging pre-adolescent night club that terrified the chaperones. Ever since, he’s spread his innovative sound in clubs from here to China.
Solomon’s specialty is something he always called “Pop Turntablism.” It’s a niche of music that fuses scratching, beat juggling, word play, and live remixing with an eclectic mix of funk, soul, hip hop and rock tracks. It’s an emerging genre now popularly known as “Mashup.” And within this community, Solomon shines. As a producer, he was among an elite group of djs and producers comprising the Crooklyn Clan Vault. The website has become one of the main distribution hubs for dj mashups and has become an invaluable tool for promoting Solomon’s unique and original production sound.
His musical stylings have captured the imagination of some of today’s biggest music stars and he’s recently performed with The Black Eyed Peas, Digital Underground, De La Soul, Ozomotli, Groove Collective, Jurassic 5, Lyrics Born, Patti Labelle, DJ AM and Dan the Automator – just to name a few. And naturally, he’s caught the eye of club promoters everywhere. Solomon has residencies all over the Western US. From San Fran to Sacto, San Diego to Scottsdale. And last year, he teamed up with singer/songwriter Chris Clouse for an insanely popular Thursday night show at the Hard Rock Hotel. The LV Weekly raved that it was “Vegas’ Best Kept Secret.” They’ve brought the party back to SF where they tear down the walls every Wednesday night at the super chic subterranean lounge, Slide. And in case you don’t like waiting in long lines outside a club he’s spinning at, you can always just buy a ticket to a Golden State Warriors home basketball game. Solomon has been the team’s resident dj for the past six years, responsible for elevating the fans’ spirits when the team sinks to new lows. Sounds like a job for a magician indeed.

The crowd respond at every turn."" - Steve McLay, DJ MAG
Always sitting slightly off-centre, Jay Tripwire is an artist that walks the line as industry staple and ever changing innovator,
releasing one standout release after another.
His signature fusion of deep Detroit textures and intricate rhythms has led a career spanning two decades,
with over 200 vinyl releases, 2 commercial mixed cd compilations, and four full length albums.
He remains one of the most prolific artists around, with an average of 15 releases per year.
He is an always an in demand remixer he averages 10-15 remixes per year.
In 2010 Jay Was honoured by being named by Future Music alongside Frankie Knuckles, Larry Heard, Charles Webster,
Atjazz, and Tom Middleton as being one of the most influentual Innovators in house music for “The thoughtful minimal stylings of Jay Tripwire.”
Most recently he’s completed a compilation mix for Steve Bug’s respected label Pokerflat –
‘Shaping Elements Vol.8’ which features a blend of deep house ranging from
Detroit inspired textures to modern European house and tech house fusions,
blurring genrefication. This follows releases on the label under his 8Channels name - a project that melds basic channel,
cosmic soul and dub into a new hybrid soundscape of techno, deep house and dub.
The moniker also appears on other highly regarded labels such as Ransom Note, Conya, NRK, Cinematic and Hallucination.
Whilst the term ‘legendary’ is often bandied about with little thought,
in Jay’s case we could say just that - his personal arsenal of re-edits and comfort in arranging extended DJ sets lasting eight hours or
more certainly demonstrates a talent that deviates from standard fare.
Jay also still supports,buys and plays vinyl, and actively seeks out records to play at gigs, when Tripwire is on the decks he plays a vinyl
and CD set.
Jay has made appearances in over 200 cities worldwide, and some of his most memorable gigs have been a decade of bookings at
Fabric London- a venue that has changed his approach to Djing, and production sound.
Jay’s work has been featured on numerous compilations, notably from Cocoon, Fabric, Renaissance, Journeys by DJ, Ultra & Bedrock,
and is supported by a diverse spectrum of dance culture from house luminaries
such as, Doc Martin and Kerri Chandler to techno legends Steve Bug and Laurent Garnier and John Digweed
With anticipated releases and remixes imminent, the Tripwire production wheel is still very much in motion,
and on its way to a turntable near you.

Please read on...

My dear Friends,
we have been active on Soundcloud for 12 years now. Since the first beta we supported this wonderful project. Unfortunately Soundcloud has changed a lot. Since there are no more groups To us SC feels like frozen. The advertising is more annoying than on Spotify - even though we pay  for it!  Our visitors are mostly good old Friends. Most of them - like on reverbnation - are also musicians. Don't get me wrong, SC is a great Place to communicate with other musicians but not so much for promotion nowadays.
. 
Many of you spend a lot of time and energy in collecting likes and comments here - but what for if no ""real"" listeners come by? You work for soundcloud many hours a month, pay for it and have to listen to their addspots, too - crazy!
Soundcloud is offering a monetization similar to Spotify for a while now, when you become a pro-member. However, you need at least 1000 plays a month and come from the ""right"" country to participate and only a few reach that number every month.

We have compared the number of  plays for some of our current tracks:

Cum Ex on SC 686 on Spotify 4131
Cum Cum on SC 393 on Spotify 3792
Farewell Fiji Islands on SC 2151 on Spotify 7944
Diversity Disappears on SC 3603 on Spotify 8309
Farmers on Fetanyl on SC 2252 on Spotify 7670

Please compare yourself: Tuh Pa Warez (maybe u need the free app to see stats) https://open.spotify.com/artist/6oJjFUCpoinLtJrCIpy7aw?si=tl0dgcMdQlmBWpp0M42rQA 

Our plan: We bring you all to Spotify - for free :-) 
There you can see how much potential your tracks really have. You will automatically get your own account and can see how often you have been heard and how many follow you.

Normally that costs money, so we give you the opportunity to remix our tracks here. We then upload them to Spotify with you as featured artist and you'll get a passive account there, which you can turn into an active one anytime you feel your tracks are well received.

So happy remixing!

In the Spring of 1999, he started working as an editor at De:Bug magazine, while also writing for other magazines and newspapers.

As a DJ, he has been a club fixture since the early 2000s, holding residencies at various locations throughout the city and playing regularly at Berghain/Panorama Bar since its inception. He is and has been touring extensively as a DJ, playing hot spots like Concrete in Paris, Robert Johnson in Offenbach, fabric in London or Golden Pudel in Hamburg, as well as festivals like Glastonbury, Nation of Gondwana, Fusion, Garbicz or Melt!. Currently he can be regularly found behind the decks at Heideglühen and STAUB.

He has released various house and techno records both solo and in groups on labels like Spencer Parker's Work Them Records, Ellen Allien's Bpitch Control, John Osborn's Dred Records and his own labels Expansion Unit and Constant Variables. Sven von Thülen has remixed (solo and in groups) A-list DJs/producers like DJ Hell, Ellen Allien or Radio Slave. He continues to work as a DJ, producer and writer.

He co-wrote (alongside Felix Denk) the oral history Der Klang der Familie - Berlin, Techno und die Wende, an in-depth look at the beginnings of Berlin's techno scene in the late eighties and early nineties, which was published in March 2012 by renowned German publisher Suhrkamp. In 2013 a French translation was published, and in October 2014 Sven von Thülen and Felix Denk self-published an English translation called Der Klang der Familie - Berlin, Techno and the Fall of the Wall, followed by a translation into Spanish in November 2015. A Russian translation will be published in late 2019.

The book was turned into a TV documentary called ""Wendeklang""/""In This Place Called Techno"", for which Sven von Thülen co-wrote the script. He also curated the soundtrack, which featured two of his own original compositions. The documentary was aired on French-German TV station ARTE in July 2014. 

In August 2020 he released his debut album Emanating on Dred Records.

In his early youth, Peter's creativity was focused on drawing, painting and sculpting. His passion for music was inspired by the wide variety of sounds played at home by his music loving mother. His interest developed further when he encountered the electronic sounds of the late 80's and amongst his favourite artists and bands were Depeche Mode, New Order, Yello, Ultravox and also Michael Jackson.

At the beginning of the 90's the then 'unusual' style of techno captured his imagination and he realised that here was a sound he'd been searching for. The futuristic themes matched his interests in science fiction and the rhythmic structures of techno, unlike any other music before, made him feel like dancing. He was fascinated by all of the new, previously unheard sounds and was keen to understand how to create them.

Soon, he'd bought his own computer, learned about music programs and eagerly set about making his own music. After years of experimentation and a long search for his own sound, he made his first digital release on Sublogic Corporation, a digital record label. The positive reaction to the release, encouraged him to circulate a few demos and within 2 weeks he'd signed his first contract with Dj Misjah’s X-Trax Records.

In 2001 he released his first record; Sweets EP on X-trax under his guise Forcesupreme. His unique, bombastic and energetic style were highly appreciated by DJs like Marco Carola, Carl Cox and Adam Beyer. The even bigger follow-up ""Funkfragment EP"" ruled the DMC world charts for several weeks. After this Peter wanted to experiment more with sound and melody and started producing tech-house with heavy Detroit influences, which resulted in releases on X-Trax Sub (Mirage EP) and Tsunami Special Blend. 

Currently, Horrevorts has records released through X-trax, Tsunami, EC Records, Phonocult, Global Underground, Echoism and Kanzleramt and has remixed work from artists such as Ferry Corsten, The Timewriter, Secret Cinema, Dj Misjah, Michel De Hey, Dj Remy and Roland Klinkenberg. 2008 saw the release of his full length debut album ""EVOLVER"" on Kanzleramt Records which received massive support from artists from many different scenes. ""EVOLVER"" can be bought as CD, VINYL or Digital format from the Kanzleramt website or other online portals.  

Horrevorts has a number of great releases coming up for 2010, so keep your ears open!

His mission: exploring electronic music with a dub mindset. 

With an open mind and always in a search for fresh musical experiences, Gabriel Le Mar likes to integrate himself in different artistic constellations  with his dub-inspired TechHouse project Dublocation as well as with the artistic collaboration with Dr. Motte.

With his projects Saafi Brothers and Aural Float, Gabriel composed ambient, space and experimental sound scapes. With Aural Float he worked on audiovisual concepts: as a team they did the artistic supervision of SPACENIGHT, a prototype of a TV-concept, utilizing spectacular film- and documentary footage from outer space with music made on earth. SPACENIGHT became a success on german television and soon reached cult status among the young night watchers until today.

On his albums Gabriel produced tracks that are tailored for the dub inspired clubber, combining different playful approaches of Dub with the functionality and stringency of techhouse music. Bridges are built by energetic and minimal grooves.

Solo and with his projects Gabriel Le Mar appeared at festivals like Time Warp, Merkwürdiges Verhalten, Pollerwiesen, Fusion, Vision, Reworks, Roskilde, Sziget, Tribal Gathering, Fusion, Hadra, Ozora...

Many artist have been launched on Eclectic Records, Knuckles (now Sovnger), Mikix The Cat, EZLV, Lerio Corrado and most recently the american songwriter and producer Damian Daviid.

While the label is growing Lorenzo still plays live sets, mainly as Blake, bringing out 15 years of the finest electronic music, either with an old-skool vynil set or a futuristic ipad + laptop + video set.

Since his youth, he has been moved from various facets of electronic, ambient and techno music. He absorbed its pureness, discovering and facing the club experience, inciting himself to expand his studio and record collection, spontaneously becoming one of the main flags representing his nation within the electronic music branch.

Initially he begins djing along Emilia Romagna coast together with Sandro Russo and Kriss, estabilishing Undercut project, while at a later stage he went back to his motherland Brindisi. Limo is a solid performer with high familiarity in playing vinyls and using analog gears: his productions, dj sets and live performances transmit passion and attention to the user physical and sonorus engagement. Limo’s artistic attitude, translate into insistent grooves and caressing textures and led him to collaborate with relevant figures of the scene like Mike Dehnert, Alan Fitzpatrick, Patrick Skoog, Arnaud Le Texier, and also proposing his sound in cities like London, Berlin, Paris, Copenaghen, Amsterdam, Barcellona and many more.

The main project we can identify Limongelli with is the event series and electronic music label Transition LAB, started in 2008 when Apulia, Limo’s region, didn’t experience such underground nights yet: the project layed the foundations with the intent of being the main pole for house and techno culture, conveyed in parties and a vinyl label. Blawan, The Analogue Cops, Deadbeat, Agaric, Markus Suckut, Roman Lindau, Truncate, Inland and other excellent producers could collaborate with Transition LAB, nowadays a certainty in terms of music quality and event atmosphere. Apart from Transition LAB, Limo main musical activities include a new label ‘Coffee Pot’ founded in 2013 together with Guido Nemola plus performing constantly within Fachwerk Records european showcases, which features dates around Europe.",1661,340,Giovanni,Giovanni Limo,0,1296,user,2018-05-10T19:30:38Z,Limo,27,15,djlimo,https://soundcloud.com/djlimo,4,,22,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/1296,soundcloud:users:1296,Limo,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:1296,artist-stations:1296,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:1296,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:16134354', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000001296-QdSGbj-original.jpg'}]",
