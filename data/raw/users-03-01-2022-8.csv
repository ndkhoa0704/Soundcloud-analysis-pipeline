At 16, he formed a small band where he stood as a drummer and played classic rock, jazz and blues.
His career in music production began in 2002 where he performed live trance music in private parties and underground raves in Montreal, Canada. Later on, Guy joined the International Producers Association (IPA), Canadian Producers Association (CPA) and Canadian Disc Jockey Association (CDJA) to be part of the generic world of composition and sound creation.

He released his first albums in 2006, ""Above & Beyond Paradise"" and ""In An Island"", followed by ""Li Beirut"" single in 2009 and ""ONE"" in 2014 to sign a come back with his music productions.

Darker is an electronic collective from the Netherlands - an international dark wave/synth pop trio inspired by the common passion for Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, Massive Atack, Nick Cave and beat driven electronic music.

It took a disorienting year like 2020 - as pieces of our everyday life were getting lost - to rediscover time, priorities and the need to communicate, the need to make music.

It was during the very particular months of the first lockdown that producer/songwriter Jeps Salfischberger (Brotherhood Foundation/Chillburn and now senior booker for Mojo Concerts) found himself back in his studio writing new music for DARKER, his creative outlet along the years. Shifting from hiphop and electronica to EDM, that alongside vocalist/keyboard player and radio producer Evelien Rombouts. DARKER has been seen on stage performing with artists like Die Antwoord, Brokencyde and Jeffree Star.

This sudden surge of new music and new sounds required a new skin, a new piece to the puzzle - found in the shape of Valerio Recenti (Voodoo Chambers/My Propane), a songwriter/producer and vocalist long active in the Dutch and international scene.

Artemis of the Wildland is often found stalking through digital forests, hunting down captivating tunes with arrow like precision. As a fawn, Artemis was trained in classical violin and voice, giving her a diverse palate for more modern musical styles. Her journey through the forests of life has given her the chance to work on stage fabrication and decorations, music, vending freshly squeezed juices, and more. 

Through these special projects and her other gigs, Artemis has been able to transcend cultures and reach people from all walks of life. “I feel renewed and awakened in a way that I had previously never thought possible. This music is magic; teaching the body to move, the mind to listen, and the soul to let go.

Known for their quirky eyewear, moppish hairstyles and retro outfits, their music is a feel-good mixture of classic rock ‘n’ roll, funk, soul, pop and surf—and with it, a generous dash of nostalgia. 

The quartet writes songs with catchy melodies that capture the soul of homegrown heroes of The Straydogs, the dynamism of Mick Jagger and the harmonic pitching of Beach Boys. 

Hailed as a class act in the local scene, they recently released their 1st Malay album, D' Antara Kita ( Among Us ) that propelled them to be nominated at Anugerah Planet Muzik, Soth East Asian regional awards.

Christopher Willits is an artist, musician, and guitarist who creates immersive ambient music. As one of the core artists on the Ghostly International label roster since the early 2000s, Willits has continually evolved his craft, producing one of the most diverse and prolific catalogs within contemporary ambient music. Releases span introspective solo albums, widescreen audiovisuals, and unbridled collaborations. His process is an expression of love, inspired by an international audience of listeners, and the conviction that music can catalyze personal transformation and spiritual awakening.

Willits began his career with a string of critically acclaimed albums on the 12k label. The minimal sound introduced on those recordings remains at the core of his work: warm guitar tones woven into smooth, harmonic surfaces. Willits made his Ghostly International full-length debut with 2006 landmark Surf Boundaries. He’d expand his vision next through collaboration, working with Ryuichi Sakamoto (2008’s Ocean Fire and 2012’s Ancient Future), Zach Hill of Death Grips, Taylor Deupree, and, for 2014 LP Opening, with the whole band of Tycho. He also lent a hand in mastering the latter’s album Awake, composed the original score for documentary The Art of Listening, and continues to lead music production and meditation classes in San Francisco.

In 2017, Willits put forth Horizon, the first ever spatial audio release on Ghostly International. The album’s innovative 3D mix is mapped to surround listeners and align with sleep patterns, meditation, and other mindful practices. Willits is also the director and co-founder of the nonprofit, Envelop; leading a mission to amplify the connective power of music through immersive audio venues and spatial audio production tools. Like Horizon, his 2019 album Sunset utilizes Envelop’s cutting-edge technology to encourage listening from within. The five compositions move from warm to cool designed as a soundtrack to embrace the day's end; a collective letting go. Another skyward, pioneering project from an artist who occupies a unique corner of the electronic music universe.",6406,894,Christopher,Christopher Willits,0,25807,user,2021-06-25T23:06:06Z,Willits,35,1,willits,https://soundcloud.com/willits,21,,143,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/25807,soundcloud:users:25807,Christopher Willits,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:25807,artist-stations:25807,creator-pro,True,False,False,soundcloud:users:25807,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:70016854', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000025807-yo0ZOJ-original.jpg'}]",

Paul Norman and Lee Chameleon and joined forces in 2005, as Monologic was evolving from a collaborative DJ project into a powerful duo. They are known for their ability to create a transcendental electronica experience by fusing a variety of dance genres into “one vibe.” Embraced by dance floors, they deliver elements of indie-rock peppered within smart, relentlessly creative synth-driven beats. 

Since then, they've entertained audiences at various national electronic events and festivals, house fests and specialty events. They have performed at Cut and Paste Fest, made numerous appearances at West Fest, the popular DEMF and DEMF Afterparties, Winter Music Conference, Chicago's Metro, Smart Bar, Vision, The House of Blues with Disco Biscuits, The Vic, Congress Theater, Looptopia, House Fest Chicago and many more. 

While serving the electronic music scene, Monologic released numerous tracks and EPs. In addition to performing alongside Radio Slave of ReKids fame and techno giant Ben Sims, they've created tracks and remixes for numerous artists in the underground electronic scene and for labels internationally. 

As a DJ, Paul has performed alongside acts including Derrick May, Dieselboy, Derrick Carter, Colette and many more. He built his reputation in the 1990's Chicago rave scene, performing at clubs and earning respect as a DJ able to master and create hybrid performances in a wide range of styles as part of groups including Disco Biscuits, Sister Machine Gun and the Conjugate Project. Lee Chameleon is a consummate multi-instrumentalist who sings with indie-rock dream pop outfit Lee & Willbee and has drummed with acclaimed band La Makita Soma, adding to Monologic's foundation. 

Ready to dive into their own music more deeply, they've arrived with their first full-length EP and created a more relaxing experience. They enlisted the assistance of mixing engineers, Mathew Shultz of Austin's Satellite Studios and Matt Opal of Chicago's Gravity Studios. To create tracks this hooky, melodic and meticulous, Monologic composes in their own project studio, Studio Metric, working with vintage pre-amps, analog pedals and instruments ranging from Moog synths to guitars. Building on this sound, they've enlisted drummer Marcus Johnson of pop/electronic outfit The Vertigo Whales and Monologic is incorporating live drums into ""live band"" shows with Aesthetic Engineer to bring fashion, visual art and photography together. 

Moving forward, this duo will still be performing their live dance pa's with new remixes from their new full length album ""The Things Themselves"" and continues to be a performance and composition force on the electronic music scene in the Midwest and globally.",272,89,PAUL,PAUL NORMAN,0,25830,user,2017-09-12T01:16:17Z,NORMAN,15,0,monologic,https://soundcloud.com/monologic,2,,14,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/25830,soundcloud:users:25830,MONOLOGIC,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:25830,artist-stations:25830,free,False,False,False,,,,

In 1991, producer/DJ's Ron Allen and Hayden Andre fused their talents and formed Strobe Records, one of the most influential house music labels of its time. The popularity of Strobe grew very quickly and its unique sound spread through North America, Europe South America and Asia.
With classic releases such as Subculture The Voyage, Helen Sharpe Got 2 Have Your Love, Hayden Andre Tribal Life The R.A.S.E. Get On Up and Afterglow- Come Back 2 Me, Strobe was one of the hottest selling house music labels around. Strobe's vision even gave birth to producer and label owner Nick Holder DNH Records with the Release of ""Digital Age"" EP.
Ron has had countless Soulful House, Deep House and Techno releases on Strobe records since 1991 and also has many features on labels such as Strictly Rhythm, Plus 8, Stickman, Definative, DNH, Poker Flat, ClubStar, Soul Candi, Tresor, Crosstown Rebels and Defected.

I think it is no coincidence that Lauren Beukes’s novel Zoo City, set in the bustling third/first world metropolis of Chris’s hometown, Johannesburg, shares the same themes of uncertain past/future merging into a recognizable edgy environment where reality is in the shadows or scowling behind the beat."" Colin Macrae

You’ll know when you’re in the Mainroom with Chris Stock, his music could be described as not in one particular sound or direction & is not restricted to one genre; instead there are elements of many, drifting seamlessly in blistering techno & minimal agendas. When performing live, audiences can expect an emotional 'electronica' ride combined with mid tempo grooves & haunting Sci-Fi glitch rhythms.

Alive & soaking rhythms have had Chris Stock's name on line-ups across continents alongside renowned artists such as Guy J, Nick Warren, Henry Saiz, Umek, Danny Howells, Luke Fair, Jim Rivers, Trafik, Wally Lopez, Stu Hirst, Hernan Cattaneo, Eelkekleijn, Richard Dinsdale, Guy Mantzur, Anil Chawla to name a few from Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town, Shanghai, Hong Kong, London, France, Abu Dhabi, India, Rome, Romania to the USA at the 70 000 attendee WMC in Miami.

Sindikalist evenings flow between the crunchy popcorn of the past and noble eclecticism of the present, while occasionally slipping into the obscure mainstream and the sugary alternative. Every person in attendance is a significant factor in the overall appearance of the evenings and for a true Sindikalist, no appearance is too appalling, no move is too dramatic, no kitsch is too cheap and no trash is too dirty.

LONELY NIGHT out on Nora En Pure's PURIFIED 
POISON out now on Gorgon City's REALM 

Official Nihil Young / Less Hate
Owner and curator of @Frequenza-Records
Hosting Dark To Light on Frisky Radio

Nihil Young’s consistent output of highly expressive electronic music — notorious for a deeply melodic, gripping and arbitrary journey, tells us more about him than words ever could. Whether releasing finely-tuned techno built firmly for the clubs, or cutting-edge progressive fit for main stages across the globe, his dynamic and masterful soundscapes overflow with emotion and are delivered in what feels like an ‘effortless’ manner. His gift for evoking emotion through mesmerizing synthesizers, precise percussion, and powerful, driving grooves is ultimately what labels of the highest order such as Toolroom, Kittball and Zerothree began to notice. 2020 served as a year of creative exploration, as Nihil expanded his sound further through his collaborative efforts with rising house artist, Paige. This stimulating partnership opened a bright new chapter of sound, consisting of vocal-led productions fusing progressive house and melodic techno, released by the likes of Gorgon City’s Realm Records and Nic Fanciulli’s Saved imprint.

Getafixx mixes a range of beautiful and blissful electronica, idm and ambient tracks with a sprinkling of voice/film/foly samples that add to the emotional roller-coaster of the aural mix. Taking inspiration from the Future Sound of London’s radio broadcasts, as well as from the philosophy of sample anything if it sounds right, Getafixx creates music mixes that are far more than just mixes, but they have to be listened to not just heard, they provoke thought as well as sooth the soul.

His range of concept mixes can be downloaded from here  https://hearthis.at/getafixx/

His role in this was master of ceremonies. Skanking rhymes from the likes of grandmaster flash over rave driven jungle.
 It wasn’t long before the lure of the Technics turntable cast its hypnotic spell with its vinyl eyes, His Passion found.
Christian took to the decks under the moniker Dreamfish (taken from the title of a chill out album by Mixmaster Morris and Peter Namlock)
Fast forward through the nineties and as the Manx club scene blossomed, The Academy and Little Caesars made way for new nights which Dreamfish played or promoted. Electrofresh, Bilng Bling, Atomik Hotdog all chartering the next 10 years of his aim to keep the Island of Mann jumping to new sounds, anything away from conventional was his sonic game plan.
Back to now, and Christian produces and plays under the name Audiowok, a name that suggests his style of play and one that has found its ways onto the airwaves of BBC3 thanks to a radio programme hosted by Andy Kershaw in 2007.
Over the last  couple of year Audiowok has played alongside some of his favourite spinners including James Lavelle.

SOR stands for quality releases ranging from hip-hop to dub to minimal to many other aspects of the wide spectrum of electronic music. With a strong emphasis on uniqueness of its releases, the label produces mostly custom limited edition vinyl to suit the needs of the active listener, the collector as well as the DJ – still believing in this format as a distinct form of expression: haptics, optics and of course the auditory sense should be attracted all at once.

Last but not least, internationality is also of utmost importance - SOR represents globally connected emergence of high grade music without denying its strong musical viennese roots.",102,43,Sonido,Sonido Ojo Rojo,0,26064,user,2017-01-23T15:34:36Z,Ojo Rojo,20,0,sonidoojorojo,https://soundcloud.com/sonidoojorojo,0,,6,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/26064,soundcloud:users:26064,SonidoOjoRojo,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:26064,artist-stations:26064,free,False,False,False,,,,

After much soul searching and relentless, failed efforts to take over the world GingerZilla took a breath and inhaled. In that Divine moment of clarity the path illuminated before him. He realised that progress is not made in great leaps, but by increments, moments in time that must be seized and nurtured. Music is Freedom not Slavery. Rhythm connects us all. 

With that breath, a germ grew which blossomed to become the first stage of his aural assault on a music world busy digesting the Music of the Dark Lords. For this reason he is fervently opposed to most music on spiritual grounds as it deeply affects his .  

...however...

...despite his hostility, negative forces must be resisted with love so the GingerZilla is quite willing to listen to anything. For this reason he believes that mashups (a.k.a. bootlegs/bastard pop) may save the world by extricating the faecal matter from pop music and making even the most banal and insipid music eminently listenable and pant wettingly funny. He is at War with Beliebers and wants to convert them with a ripple effect of mash ups continuing the work of the Prophet Bill Hicks.

In the early days of his career, he co-hosted the successful Travelling Without Moving night and shared the 1210s on many occasions with the likes of Terry Francis, Clive Henry (Peace Division), Andy Wetherall, Rob Mello, Atjazz, Digs’n’Woosh, Rocky, Elliot Eastwick, Fred Everything, A Man Called Adam, House of 909, the DIY DJ’s plus many more.

In 2000, he played out a dub plate of one of his first productions. The guest DJ, Clive Henry (Peace Division) immediately signed it to his label, Low Pressings. Later that year, Da Sunlounge followed it up with a second release on Low Pressings, which was played by Danny Rampling to open his Radio 1 show live from Ibiza.
Shortly after, Da Sunlounge was head hunted by Canadian label 83 West to release on their sub-label Camouflage recordings. Alongside the likes of H-Foundation, DJ Sneak, Peace Division, Gene Farris, Stacy Kidd, and DJ Rasoul.
As his career progressed, Da Sunlounge went on to release on numerous labels including, Cajual, King Street, Defected, Mother Recordings, 2020 Vision, OM, Salted Music, Outcross, and remixing artists such as Mood II Swing , Crazy P & Roland Clark, and more recently Miguel Campbell & Sonny Fodera.
His music also found its way on to front cover mounts such as Mixmag, and compilation CDs by Fabric, Defected, Ministry of Sound, Mn2S, NRK and Hed Kandi.

In 2001, his own label Myna Music was launched, gaining support from a wide array of DJs around
the globe and picking up plays on leading radio stations such as Radio 1. Myna has remained strong over the years and reached it’s 15th year anniversary in 2016 with a back catalogue of over 60 releases. In 2005, Da Sunlounge launched his second label, Bambino Recordings.
In 2008 he joined forces with Andy Riley (Inland Knights) to launch the Borrowed Music label.

The success of Da Sunlounge’s productions subsequently led to a busy international DJ schedule, playing at some outstanding events. To name a few memorable ones...
- DJ’ing at the top of Sugarloaf Mountain in Brazil
- Boat party around Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge
- Playground Weekender in Australia on the same bill as Laurent Garnier
- Pacha, Dubai on the same bill as Dimitri from Paris
- DJ’ing within a castle grounds in Bratislava
- Playing huge beach parties to 1000s in Eastern Europe
- At home in the UK, at the world renowned Fabric, Abode & Hot Bed events in London.

Over the past two decades, DJ’ing has taken him to the USA, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Dubai, South Africa, Serbia, Spain, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Georgia, Croatia, Turkey, Slovakia, Poland, Denmark, Latvia, Germany, Belgium, Bulgaria, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and of course all over the UK.

2019 still sees Da Sunlounge holding his own, with chart topping tracks on Beatport & Traxsource, and gaining a place in the Traxsource top 100 Artist's and best selling tracks of 2015/2016/2017/2018.",12530,224,Da,Da Sunlounge,0,26100,user,2021-05-16T20:41:41Z,Sunlounge,129,23,da-sunlounge,https://soundcloud.com/da-sunlounge,52,,219,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/26100,soundcloud:users:26100,DA SUNLOUNGE,True,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:26100,artist-stations:26100,free,False,False,True,soundcloud:users:26100,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:87537612', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000026100-YZ69sV-original.jpg'}]",

Techno DJ/producer Joran van Pol has a somewhat special story. His debut release ‘Untitled 2’ was signed to Richie Hawtin’s Minus, followed by Joran's seminal release 'Faded'. Where do you go from there? Well, with the ‘Implicit E.P.’ on Dubfire’s Sci+Tec, several releases on Joris Voorn’s label Rejected, a remix and full E.P. ’Immediate E.P.’ on Matador’s Rukus and a collab with Maksim
Dark ‘Thrill’ on Senso Sounds. ‘Derelict’ on Pan-Pot's Second State was added in 2020.

Meanwhile, Joran kept working tirelessly to hone his craft in the studio. Inspired by the current wave of bare and heavy techno, he managed to create a new iteration of his sound. His stark and heavy, yet minimalistic, techno marks the resurgence of Joran van Pol.

Perhaps even more so than his production efforts, Joran has built quite the reputation when it comes to his DJ-sets. Starting his career at the infamous underground club Studio 80 in Amsterdam, he quickly transitioned to big venues and events like Awakenings, Dockyard, Tomorrowland, Fuse Brussels, Welcome To The Future, Loveland and Timewarp.

As a DJ, Producer, 3° global co-founder and former EsNtion Records Dance division manager, Monna is working towards his next career move, Globalization.
In his words, “I want the world to listen!”

Who is Monna? Monna is a Dj/Producer and co-founder of 3° Global which is known for its “Some Call It House”, We Call It Home” North American Tour and its weekly members-only gatherings.

He watched it evolve from the disco scene and soon began adding his own creations and interpretations through his musical talents.

As a 3° Global co-founder, Monna’s steady strength and passion for life and music has helped create a grass roots industry alliance based on the six degrees of separation. With a membership of 5000+ music connoisseurs a large part of 3° Global’s success is the ability to bridge many communities through the common love of music. Striving to showcase the industries established and up and coming talent the company launched a North American Tour in 2002. The tour kicks off at WMC in Miami, continues to ‘DEMF’ in Detroit and ventures onto Chicago, San Francisco, Tampa, Washington D.C. and Los Angeles.

Rino Coppola was a little boy when he started playing bass guitar and accordion, which both made him realize his inborn involvement with music. The passion he developed led him to keep on studying more and more in order to move on with the musical tendencies and to gain experience. Now Rino has found
his artistical dimension: his sound is the right patchwork of house/club music matched up with great deep music.

During the 2009 he was very busy in making new interesting projects among wich ""Old Things"" stands out. This is an EP released by the label ""Sleep Is Commercial"" that marks the renewal of his sound. Rino has been beeing also resident dj into the ""rehab"" crew since 2010.

The last releases are more interesting, the ultimate one is ""Ipnose Ep"" which consists of 3 original techhouse tracks and 2 remixes. That work has been appreciated by several artists like Marco Carola, Josh Wink, Someone Else, Ray Okpara, DUbfire, Paco Osuna, Nic Fanciulli Timo Mass and many moore.
""Mas o menos Ep"" on 12"" will be the next release; it consists of the original track plus four remixes of Santos, Alex Dolby, Stefano Lotti and Dave Manuel.
His first personal album, made up of several tracks, will be out next year.At the moment Rino is working hard with his fellow friend Francesco Di Marco on a new project as ""Livin Wires"".Stay tuned for more mirabilia!!!!

Regarded by many as a true DJ's MC, his ability to read crowds, compliment mix structures, and facilitate the transfer of energy between DJ and audience is second to none.

Now deep into his second decade as an MC, LowQui has continuously worked on a global scale as MC of choice for the best. The Metalheadz family, Goldie, S.P.Y, dBridge, Andy C, DJ Marky, Black Sun Empire, Skream, Benga, Storm, The Upbeats, the list goes on.

Earning his stripes in the 90s London club/rave circuit, LowQui took his inspiration from the legendary double-time raps of Stevie Hyper D (RIP) and the razor sharp lyrical delivery of MC GQ. Merging both with the concepts of harmony and balance, he forged his distinctive LowQui sound.

LowQui breaks down the barrier between performer and attendee like no other. He is the quintessential DIY junglist. In the game for life, LowQui will be toasting microphones until the end of his days.

With his fresh sound he’s featured the biggest parties and festivals of the Netherlands, and he also has been a regular guest at Fedde le Grand and Funkerman’s prestigious Flamingo Nights. By now the Dutch borders can’t contain him any longer! This past year Johnstar has been a welcomed guest in a.o. Spain, France, Belgium and the UK.

Having traded in his old attic for a brand-new studio, Johnstar is fully reloaded with a matured sound. With releases on imprints such as Toolroom and Stealth, and remix-requests from a.o. Afrojack and most recently Nicky Romero & Mitch Crown it’s safe to say Johnstar is growing into his dream, steadily turning it into reality. Currently he’s working on some very exciting new material. So be prepared, ‘cause Johnstar is ready to rock…are you?

From  RCA to Atlantic Records, Misha's mother, father and grandparents all have had major label success. As a result, she spent most of her early childhood development in the same studios as Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the SOS Band, Isaac Hayes and many other music legends. As a child, Misha Fair trained as a classical vocalist but found her passion in jazz, hip hop and the gritty alternative sound of the mid 90s.
In 2004, Misha Fair heard an independent demo of Janelle Monae and became determined to work with her team. By 2008, 
       Misha became a part of the Wondaland Arts Society ""family"". While working there, Misha sang vocals on a collaborative single of David Bowie’s “Moonage Daydream”, which starred Janelle Monae and alt-experimental band, Of Montreal and also featured vocals by Roman Gian Arthur, and indie Afropunk bands Deep Cotton and Tendaberry. After departing from the team, Misha went on to manage several studios in her hometown of Atlanta, while simultaneously maintaining a career as Vocal Coach, Singer-songwriter and Performance Artist.
       Misha Fair is a diverse performance artist with live performance and studio experience ranging from singing in the Netherlands with Natalie “The Floacist"" Stewart of the group Floetry to writing and recording records with Case, Bad Boy’s Mason Betha, Jazze Pha, and David Banner. Currently, Misha Fair is working with super producer Mark “Chop Diesel” Curry of 3KingzEmpire (formerly Tha Dream Team) along with a team of incredible artists and producers on her widely anticipated EP, ""Venus in Retro"".
       The eclectic influences surrounding Misha Fair have molded her into an extremely well rounded artist. Misha balances bold, nostalgic vocal arrangements and honest lyrical content which is described as a soulful blend of folk, hip hop, alternative and pop.",60,35,Misha,Misha Fair,0,26179,user,2018-04-05T21:17:37Z,Fair,12,2,mishafair,https://soundcloud.com/mishafair,0,,3,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/26179,soundcloud:users:26179,Misha Fair,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:26179,artist-stations:26179,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:26179,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:31702779', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000026179-KTf5cT-original.jpg'}]",

With a knack for combining energetic bleepy techno underpinnings with emotive soundscapes, sixfootsix plays music that hits the heart, hips and head.

Brooding basslines darker than a black cat in a coal cellar mingle with uplifting synths that’ll have your spine tingling like a sherbet epidural.

A true artist will always have something that makes them stand out from the crowd. In the case of Emmanuel its his wonderful ability to transfer his daily emotions and experiences, into the music that he creates.  Srilankans and Maldivians roots, born in Pireo (Greece) in 1987, Emmanuel, despite his young age, it's already a well travelled guy. After a short stay in Greece he moved alongside his family towards the grey and foggy north of Italy, Milan with precision. Here he spent most of his recent past. During his long trips music has never been missing by his experiences background. From his early passion for the etno-folk melodies of the countries in which his Dna sinks his roots, he soon moved to new sounds, quickly founding great interests in the electronic phenomena.

  Interests that were too often limited, interests that after a few weeks were already aiming to become something more, to become his own thing. That so, aged 16, Emmanuel approached the first softwares and started doing music. In so doing, in a short lap of time, he got in touch with several artists and started to establish his relationship with a few big names.
  
  It's winter 2007 when, thanks to his last demo (A Step From You/Parade EP), he got in touch with the israelian dj and producer Shlomi Aber. An enlightening encounter for both them, an encounter which soon led Aber to sign Emmanuel for his own Imprint, Be As One. And judging by the results of Emmanuel's first release it's not hard to be understood why Aber didn't lose any time in sign him and get him into the techno rumble.
 His debut release ""Parade EP"" got some really serious support from some of the biggest names in Techno and House. 

And with his second release ""Indian Wallpaper"", always on Be As One, Emmanuel strongly confirm his skill. With airplays feat by the likes of names like Sven Vath, Regis, Carl Cox, Marcel Dettman, John Digweed, Josh Wink, Ben Klock, and Adam Beyer to name a few, Emmanuel then moved to Berlin to dedicate his full time to the Label and the craft of his music. 

Today he runs ARTS one of the most prominent Institution in Techno and Electronic Music with regular Artists that today are representing the soul of the Underground Techno to bigger stages with regular Showcases around the Globe, there's no doubt if Emmanuel's name will be one of the most talked about names of the very next future.",10685,304,ㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ,ㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ Owner of ARTS  ╲  Darkmatter Inc.,0,26230,user,2020-12-01T07:02:01Z,Owner of ARTS  ╲  Darkmatter Inc.,1,2,emmanuel,https://soundcloud.com/emmanuel,4,,26,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/26230,soundcloud:users:26230,Emmanuel,True,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:26230,artist-stations:26230,free,False,False,True,soundcloud:users:26230,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:5182652', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000026230-UPJILh-original.jpg'}]",

Hailing from the nations “Air Capital” of Wichita, KS, SOULICIT has the entire Midwest on notice. With their own blend of modern edge and southern rock sound the main stage is no stranger to these guys. Sharing festival main stages with names like Buckcherry, FUEL, FLAW, Anew Revolution, Pop Evil, Texas Hippie Coalition, Twsited Sister & Styx the SOULICIT sound is truly on a national level. 

Comprised of lead vocalists/guitarist Darick Parson, lead guitarist/vocalist Dan “The Danimal” Weaver, bassist/vocalist Andrew Weaver & drummer Trent Boehner, SOULICIT brings years of experience to the stage. Together since 2002 the band has gained praise from fans all over the world through their catchy songs and straight forward guitar driven hard rock. 

The guys are currently back in the studio working on the new album with producer Alex Gerst at Indian Trail Recording Studios in Sanger, TX. In October of 2010 SOULICIT released 2 singles from the upcoming album “You Are the Song” and “Blow Me Away”. Since release the singles have remained at the top of online Modern Rock charts earning them a number of accolades including: #1 in Modern Rock charts on Ourstage.com, 5 Top 10 Finishes, 4 Top 40 Finishes, and Reached 4th in Best of Rock in 2011. You can also find the songs in regular rotation on a number of terrestrial radio stations around the region as well as online radio stations around the globe. In response to the release of the 2 songs the band has been offered indie label and management deals but SOULICIT continues to wait it out for that right fit. Big things are happening right now in the world of SOULICIT and you can almost hear the buzz as it builds surrounding the release of their newest full length studio effort. With even bigger and more bad ass tunes yet to come it won’t be long until you see the boys rolling through a town near you!",35,0,,,0,26271,user,2011-10-21T18:28:14Z,,0,0,soulicit,https://soundcloud.com/soulicit,0,,0,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/26271,soundcloud:users:26271,Soulicit,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:26271,artist-stations:26271,free,False,False,False,,,,

Enter Dulce Vita (pronounced dol-sie/vee-tah).

Nationally requested, dance floor approved! In direct response to specific performances at Burning Man, she has been invited to rock stages in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Chicago, Boise, San Diego.  As a DJ performer in San Francisco, how does DV stand out? True individuality happens here as a result of a musical risk. Using the cross fader as her primary canvas with a signature brand of aggressive intent, she performs a sound all her own - an energetic soundscape peppered with feelgood emotion, including audible hints of breakbreaks, bass house, tech house,  glitch-hop, big beat, chunky electro, world beats, downtempo, dubstep and IDM. Experience a sound that is funky, grooving, grinding, raw, twisted, and hard - but all at once! That is quintessential DV.

Dulce considers any single performance a personal success if she can make a deeply positive impact on at least one person's experience. Since her debut performance at Google headquarters in 2004, you might have already experienced her audio collage of eclectic tracks at underground warehouse venues or major nightclubs such as The Midway, Public Works, The Great Northern, Monarch, Temple.  In the past, Dulce was named WINNER of SF Weekly: City of Spin 2009 (Annual DJ Competition) and her performance at Burning Man earned a prestigious mention in international publication 'DJ Mag' within the 2008 issue featuring Top 100.

Over the years, Dulce has held down numerous DJ residencies based in San Francisco. In 2006, she was proud to be selected as the first female to be affiliated with 'OPULENT TEMPLE' (the infamous large-scale sound camp at Burning Man featuring world class DJs on over 300,000 watts). In 2009, she was invited to wobble out with 'CALIFORNIA DUBSTEP REPUBLIC', a collective of performers who provided the first ever Dubstep float in San Francisco's equivalent of a large scale EDM festival like Love Parade. That year also debuted her solo event production alias: 'DVANT GARDE'. DV created a new breed of event (known as 'Womper Womb') showcasing dubstep, glitch, and breaks with all female DJ talent from Burning Man. Dulce Vita booked nearly 100 performances as a DJ in 2009.  

In 2010, she gained a new monthly residency with 'BELOW ZERO', featuring downtempo, chillout, trip-hop, and IDM.  'UNDERGROUND NOMADS' was introduced in 2013, a weekly show featuring global bass and world step in combination with belly dance performance. Dulce spent many years feeling at home within the Northern California campout and  invitational festival circuit involving Burning Man communities. In 2020, Dulce became officially affiliated with 'STRATEGIK SF'.  Burning Man community based groups she has performed with over the years also include: DUCK POND, ROOT SOCIETY, DISTRIKT, HOOKADOME, SPACE COWBOYS, DUSTY RHINO, BRASS TAX, FLAMING LOTUS GIRLS, SLUT GARDEN, DISORIENT, DANCETRONAUTS, SACRED SPACES, BASS CAMP, NEXUS, OSIRIS, BMIR.  

Dulce has also provided A&R representation in past at Winter Music Conference in Miami for two Oakland based labels, Mizumo Music (tech, filtered disco, and electro house) and Funky Cactus Recordings (big beat and nu skool breaks).. Her actual birth name is Dulce Vita.",1634,321,Dulce,Dulce Vita,0,26280,user,2021-03-11T06:22:51Z,Vita,61,3,dulcevitadj,https://soundcloud.com/dulcevitadj,0,,13,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/26280,soundcloud:users:26280,DulceVitaDJ,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:26280,artist-stations:26280,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,soundcloud:users:26280,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:96709275', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000026280-O179xD-original.jpg'}]",

After a string of releases in 2007 and 2008 that received great support, it was his track “Simple” that secured the youngster’s spot on the global stage. First championed by Pete Tong, the track gained huge global support from the likes of Deadmau5, Prok &amp; Fitch, Belocca, and dozens more, and was also featured on Azuli’s Space Annual compilation.
 He was also recently featured on Roger Sanchez's ""Release Yourself"" compilation, and has had releases on the mighty Toolroom Records and PBR Recordings.
His upbringing in the American Midwest has allowed him to develop a unique sound without influence from trendy cities like Los Angeles, New York, and Miami. His upcoming releases demonstrate this unique fusion of thick, chunky rhythms and subtle melodic grooves.
Yet his production success has not come at the expense of his DJ abilities - thrice being awarded the local DJ of the Year award in 2007, 2008 and 2009. He has shared the decks with nearly every superstar DJ imaginable, including Tiesto, David Guetta, Benny Benassi, Deadmau5, Fedde Le Grand, Robbie Rivera, Ferry Corsten, Dj Dan, Markus Schulz, and many many more.

DJ Bandwagon is one such outlier. 

Bandwagon, real name Brandon Jenkins, has spent two decades as a producer and DJ, artfully weaving his way through House, Downbeat, Electro, Dubstep, Techno, Breaks, Tribal, Hip-Hop and Funk. And his musical roots run deeper yet; prior to Bandwagon status, he recorded and mixed under the aliases unKphae and Johnny Law—earning residencies at legendary L.A. “massive” events Opium and Conscious Groove.

Twenty years as a performance stalwart does wonders for the résumé. DJ Bandwagon has shared the stage with a veritable who’s who in electronica: A-Trak; Bassnectar; BT; Deadmau5; Dieselboy; DJ Craze; DJ Dan; DJ Keoki; DJ Spooky; Doc Martin; Donald Glaude; Goldie; Gus Gus; Hybrid; Kaskade; Kill the Noise; Little Dragon; LTJ Bukem; MING & FS; Perry Farrell; QBert; Richie Hawtin.

DJ Bandwagon has paid his dues in spades. And his persistence has paid off: he’s now set to release a spate of tracks on Hood Famous Music, the brainchild of Aaron “MING” Albano, one-half of erstwhile groundbreaking drum ‘n’ bass duo MING  & FS. Additionally, MING counts himself among the chosen few, on the roster of superstar DJ Steve Aoki’s Dim Mak Records. 

The first arrow in Bandwagon’s quiver is “Xenon;” steeped in disco, “Xenon” tantalizes first with old-school minimal vibes, then transitions into funky, rafter-rattling nu-disco. 
Find “Xenon” here: http://www.beatport.com/release/xenon/1017103

Elsewhere, Bandwagon flexes his remix chops. Trumpets MING: ""Hood Famous Music is proud to present DJ Bandwagon and his indie dance remix of MING's ‘Shine Your Light,’ available March 11th.  Look for a number of original and remixed tracks from DJ Bandwagon on Hood Famous Music. DJ bandwagon is definitely one producer to watch trail-blaze in 2013!” 

From there, the pair picks up steam:  On March 25th, run for cover as MING and DJ Bandwagon drop The Daze Remix EP, featuring Benny Lowe and remixes from Circles of Light and Infernal Devices.
