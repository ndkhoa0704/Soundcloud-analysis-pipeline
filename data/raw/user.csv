BIO:
Gioele Giacopelli as JWL is an Italian DJ and producer. He began to love music since he was only a kid, thanks to the domestic environment. His 360 degrees musical groundwork has been settled first by his parents (dad is a bass player and mum a great singer) who introduced him to artists such as Stevie Wonder, Pino Daniele and others from the 70’s and 80’s. When he started “walking with his own legs” and so creating a proper knowledge of different musical genres and artists, JWL discovered to have a big feeling for the Afro-American music culture (Soul, R’n’B, Funk, Jazz, Hip Hop, and so on) losing himself into the local hip hop scene. 2000 marks the first JWL's approach to the dance culture: he began to listen to some Masters At Work's productions and he was delighted about that sonority called House. Afterward, he bought his first console and started to collect vinyl records. In the following years, Gioele enriched his dance culture attending constantly at Red Zone Club in Perugia and it was fundamental for his growth. In 2005 he setted up his own studio and started producing music, gradually stepping in the Perugia underground scene, supported by various DJ's, among which Ricky L and Sauro Cosimetti. 2011 marks for JWL his first digital release of his track “Hot Love” on the American label ""Plus Plus"". In September of 2012 he remixed Double Beat's track ""The Sense Of Truth"", released on ""Soul Shift Music"". After that, he made a track called “The Whistle Track” released on “The Yellow Drumachine EP” (Adult Dance Music) and in February of 2013 he made a remix of Joy Lee and Speakdeep's track ""Geist"", out on “Mind Your Hate”. JWL’s remix of Joy Lee’s track “On The Road”, released in November 2013 on “Sexonwax”, has preceded the turning point in his career, his first vinyl release on the Umbria-based label “Fortezza Records” with a track called “Little Theme”. This track, belongs to a banging four tracker EP featuring artists such as Mass Prod and Rufus, Giovanni Ferretti and Speakdeep. This EP was supported by a lot of Italian and international artists, for instance Mister G and Boyd Jarvis. In June 2015, JWL signed another important vinyl release on the UK label “Phatway Traxx”. This EP named “The Disco Cuts EP”, was first in many charts and the JWL’s track “Again’n’Again, contained on the b-side, it was supported by big artists like Ben Ufo. In 2016, he became part of the Berlin-based label “Soundscapes Records/Escape Series” and signed a four tracker EP in collaboration with the Tuscany musician and producer “INNO”. This amazing EP will be released on vinyl in the next months. JWL has performed in many important clubs such as “KaterBlau” (Berlin), “Red Zone Club/B-Side” (Perugia), “Serendipity/Rec Room“ (Foligno), “DOT Club” and important festivals as “Collective”, “SoundOf”, “Terni Factory”, “Interleave” and so on.
