It's hand-built, designed for Milwaukee and we think it can welcome a lot of folks into the world of non-commercial radio. Every day, you'll hear the ideas, aspirations and opinions of people who care about their community and are doing something to make it better.

We're here for the folks who know the radio doesn't have to be just more of what we already know. We're here for the folks who know the radio is able to connect us and kick off meaningful conversations about our lives and culture, but see that, lately, it hasn't made much of an effort. 

Our eventual goal is simple: we want 100% of our audience to participate in the RadioMilwaukee-making process. Yeah. It's completely unrealistic and presumptuous, but we're like that. Hit the comments on the blogs, tell us about someone doing an amazing thing in the neighborhood, hip us to your favorite artist. Tell us where we're not meeting your needs and tell us how we can fix it. Become a financial supporter, even!

 Blending dancefloor jazz, deep house, hip hop, funk, soul, boogie and many other musical styles comes very natural to these boys, and their sets have taken them around the region. Between them, and their unique semi live DJ partnership, they have rocked floors across continents, in Switzerland, Italy, London, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Vietnam and Indonesia and more. They have also played alongside many established DJs and musicians like Tiger & Woods, Souleance, Fulgeance, Dåm Funk, Basic Soul Unit, Jamie XX, Danilow Plessow, Kerri Chandler, KiNK, Jazzanova, Recloose, Gerd Janson, Linkwood, DJ Vadim, KOOP, Alex from Tokyo, Todd Terje, Joakim, and Lefto, amongst many others. 

Their Cosa Nostra productions and edits have also gained recognition among music tastemakers worldwide, having been charted by heavyweights such as Lefto and House music guru Phil Asher.

In Singapore, their experience is untouchable having played in all the well known big (and small) clubs, as well as having played alongside some of the finest acts in the world.

Thank you for stopping by. I'm a music and radio producer. You can check out my blog where I pontificate about living under medical martial law in America in 2020 since March 23rd.

My bio needs to be updated but this will give you an idea.....

Mitch Santell is a 3rd Generation Native Californian whose family began in the motion picture industry in 1914 and to this day are remembered as industry leaders. Santell’s grandfather and great-uncle were a directing team for 40 years directed and produced over 90 motion pictures for 20th Century Fox, Universal, Paramount, MGM, RKO and Warner Brothers. Alfred Santell (Great Uncle) and Martin Santell (Grandfather) started the careers of David Niven and Red Skelton. Marion Davies was the godmother of Richard Santell (Mitch's Dad).
                                                          
  When Mitch's Grandfather retired from the motion picture business and then along with Mitch's Dad (Richard) opened 3 small retail record stores in 1955 located in West Covina, Inglewood and Hacienda Heights. Marty's Music was a mainstay of West Covina until the stores closed in 1975.
                                                          
 Mitch was exposed to music through his Dad's record store. In the USA Mitch started 3 music labels and has financed and produced several dozen albums. The first label Full Circle Music produced albums with John Phillips (Mama's and Papa's) and Leon Russell. The second label was with David Tickle who produced and engineered Prince, U2, and Sting. The third label was Evening Star with Nik Venet.
                                                          
Mitch Santell was mentored by Nik Venet who produced and discovered Linda Rondstadt, The Beach Boys, Jim Croce, Don McClean, Bobby Darren, along with spoken word projects including the 2000 Year Old Man with Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner. Mitch helped Nik launch his own label prior to his passing in 1998.                                            
                                                          
Mitch Santell has been responsible for launching over 31+ radio shows. Ninety percent of his clients have never been on the air before and launch their own show within 60-90 days of working with him. Over one third of his clients end up with their own nationally syndicated show. His current strategic alliances include ABC Radio Network, Clear Channel Communications, Salem Communication, CBS/Infinity and Citadel. Mr. Santell has a passion for helping people to do their dream.

As the world watches the renaissance and revival of Detroit, it listens for the sound of those carrying the torch of authentic Motor City-born techno into the future. Brian Kage is one of those innovators leading Detroit’s electronic music forward into the musical zeitgeist of change and revolution. 

Kage was recently crowned one of DJ magazine’s “10 Detroit Producers Keeping the Sound of the Motor City Alive.”

Detroit born-and-raised Kage co-founded record label Beretta Music, through which he mentored and helped shape the careers of many internationally respected DJs and producers.  Kage has also released well-received music on Omar S’s record label FXHE, Carl Craig’s Planet-E, Steve Bug’s PokerFlat, Rob Modell’s Echospace, and many more. Kage’s “DetroitLuv” record was featured and played on BBC Radio 1’s Essential Mix by Richie Hawtin and Ricardo Villalobos.

Kage’s “The Arc EP,” released on his own Michigander label, pays tribute to Detroit with its uplifting melodic techno style. “The Arc EP” was also featured and praised on Resident Advisor’s “New Tracks” list. Additionally, DJ magazine praised his collaboration with vocalist James Garcia, ‘Shut Your Eyes’, as “one of 2015’s best house tracks.” 

When he’s not working on his own music, Brian is working alongside local and international acts to mix, master and engineer their music with “KageMastering.” 

A vital part of Detroit’s rich techno history, Brian Kage is one of the artists and producers providing the score for the Motor City’s continuing rebirth. This is the sound of the future.

When it comes to putting his own twist on classic house production, Chicago’s DJ Bam Bam is king. As owner of the esteemed Fly House Records, Bam has remained an underground dance music mainstay since signing on with Strictly Hype Recordings in the late ‘90s. Since then, he has toured the globe on several mix compilations, and most recently, hit No. 1 on Beatport’s Electro House chart for his track, “Watch The Club Go.” For more info visit https://djbambam.com

Measax Wellman began djing in early 2004 and right before graduating with a degree in philosophy he took on a resident spot at club R2 in Charlottesville, Virginia alongside long time friend Brian Boyd. His djing style was influenced by a love for obscure art and music, which eventually filtering down to minimalism. Since then he has made several moves throughout the state and has helped cultivate a small avant-garde group of minimal freaks. With house mates Jeffrey S. aka Docindo Dorsey and Clinc, he currently helps run events in Virginia and Washington D.C. focused on minimal techno and micro house. 

His production style developed from a childhood obsession with recorders and keyboards and much of it comes from samples he has recorded and collected himself. His sound is influenced by a very eclectic taste in music including bebop jazz, dub reggae, punk rock, underground disco, and early chicago house.",173,6,Maxwell,Maxwell Joseph,0,4513,user,2017-02-04T04:13:52Z,Joseph,4,0,measax,https://soundcloud.com/measax,0,,4,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/4513,soundcloud:users:4513,measax,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:4513,artist-stations:4513,free,,,,,False,False,False,

that have been making waves way beyond their hometown of Arnhem in 2015. From their first forays into making music under various guises, Kamara were formed in 2010 and have been steadily building their way up through the echelons of the electronic underground.
This past year the guys have unleashed material on A-list labels such Tronic Music, Sudbeat, Bush, Natura Viva and Proton, picking up remixes along the way from legendary artists such as Carl Cox, Oliver Lieb, Tom Hades, Daniel Nitsch / The Glitz.

Of course records on these kinds of labels don’t go unnoticed. Their material has been played and championed by a wide range of their peer artists such as Nicole Moudaber, Christian Smith, Sian, Sasha, Technasia and Laurent Garnier, proving that labels and DJ’s alike are buying into the Kamara sound.

Their sound palette is wide ranging within the techno sphere. From heavy repetitive techno with ethnic undertones, to a more melodic yet driving tech house sound, their musical path comes from the inspiration they get from the many different musical cultures they incorporate into their tracks. These worldly influences are distinctively heard in their sets, which are underpinned by the universal sound of electronic music.

And because life isn’t all about making and playing music Kamara also invest a lot of time into their successful party Metamorphosa. This party create a space where the musical identity of Kamara gets a wider exposure and it offers a great opportunity to collaborate and perform with other artists.

Performances have been made at other leading events around the globe too, with festival and club appearances at Fusion Festival (DE) , Midi Festival (CN), Kommt Zusammen (DE), Ying Yang (Great Wall, China) Free Your Mind Festival (NL), Lantern (CH), Panama (NL) and The Mansion (CH).

Kamara have put themselves on a fast track to success with the right balance of hard work and talent. With more material getting interest from established labels, and the foundations they have already put down at Tronic, Bush and Sudbeat, you know Kamara are an act you will be hearing a lot more from.",4644,560,Techno | Live-act | Dutch,Techno | Live-act | Dutch Kamara Live,0,4521,user,2020-03-24T12:50:08Z,Kamara Live,64,8,kasperkwant,https://soundcloud.com/kasperkwant,24,,103,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/4521,soundcloud:users:4521,KAMARA,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:4521,artist-stations:4521,creator-pro-unlimited,soundcloud:users:4521,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:128447028', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000004521-XK1Jy9-original.jpg'}]",,False,True,False,

Sadly his elvish mother passed from complications during birth, and one fateful night not long after,  he was found by his human adoptive parents on their doorstep. They were sheep farmers in the valley below and in a letter they found by his side, they were promised the protection of their flock in exchange for raising him as their own. Knowing the many tales of wrath inflicted on villagers not complying with their highland neighbors, they took him in straight away and Hólmar spent his formative years on their quaint farm. 

His mother, an avid swimmer, would bring him to the cold mountain lakes during the summer months and teach him all there was to know about being the best there was in the water. It was during one of these lessons, he was discovered by the national synchronized swimming coach, who by chance was hiking in the area. Enamored by Hólmar’s raw talent, he negotiated his move from the tranquil countryside to the nations capital, Reykjavik City. There he began his training and quickly became an integral member of the Icelandic squad. It was during the course of his training for the Olympics in Seoul, that he suffered a serious injury which ended his professional swimming career abruptly. Fortunately, he was able to continue his passion for synchronized group movements above water and formed a dance troupe called the “Black Widows”.  He traveled with them all over Scandinavia winning multiple competitions and dance off’s.

Throughout his time with the “Widows"" he discovered his passion for music while putting together playlists for their shows. Eventually he was asked to perform these playlists ""live"" at parties all over Reykjavik's then bustling underground scene. After many late night gigs, not showing up to practice and seriously messing up some of their shows, he was promptly ousted from the troupe. This was a devastating moment for Holmar and after a great deal of soul searching, he moved to New York.  

There he hit the ground running and started throwing rollicking parties all over the Big Apple. He formed the infamous Crack & Speed Records with his good Parisian friend Jef-k. On C&S he debuted his music as a part of the “super” group Mr. Negative & The Spencer Filipsson Experience.

During one of Holmar’s parties at a former brothel on the Lower East Side, he met Greg Oreck and shortly thereafter founded “Thugfucker”. After working together for a few years, during one hot summer night in Hólmar’s studio in Williamsburg, they created “Disco Gnome”. This record ended up being the first release on Life and Death Records and launched them into the international scene along with Tale of Us and Dj Tennis. He spent next years touring with Greg and fellow mates at Life and Death causing general mayhem and good times at clubs and festivals all around the globe. 

In 2011 he went to Burning Man for the first time, a pivotal moment for him, and now he can be found every year, riding his bike around and playing many marathon sets all week long. 

In recent years in addition to his work with ""Thugfucker"" he has started new collaborations. He co-founded “Lovestruckk” with Nico Stojan, “Theory of Light” with Brian Cid, “The Birds Fly South” with Maxxi Soundsystem and his first release in 2018 will be an E.P with L.A’s Jon Charnis.  He is also a part of a new dj collective the infamous ""Twisted Sisterz"".

In 2018 we will see his departure from “Thugfucker"",  launching his solo career.

He has now brought his dancing shoes back out of retirement and has staged new impromptu of dance performances of the ""Black Widows"" on and off stage during his shows, staying true to his choreography roots…",2286,315,Holmar,"Holmar ""Acid Tourist""",0,4556,user,2022-01-18T20:58:46Z,"""Acid Tourist""",30,4,holmarmusik,https://soundcloud.com/holmarmusik,0,,1,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/4556,soundcloud:users:4556,holmar,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:4556,artist-stations:4556,creator-pro-unlimited,soundcloud:users:4556,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:146458497', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000004556-5J4Pdd-original.jpg'}]",,False,True,False,

In this year they decided to carry out their experiences, starting to work as remixers. Cerronza first remixed “Sam”, by Scuola Furano, and included in the compilation A Medium Party for Riotmaker label; then followed in 2007 the remixes of “Kissinger” by Carnifull Trio (included in “Song for Guido” EP), of “Discount” by Funkabit (included in “Discount” EP) and of “Francis Turner” by Awesome Mixtape.
In 2008 they attended the Frost DjSexx’s contest on Fairtilizer, winning it with their remix of “Borotalco”.
During this period Cerronza has performed in various club in north-eastern Italy, basing their dj-sets on deep house sounds, inspired by music from New York and Chicago.

John Acquaviva as a DJ/Producer and Entrepreneur has flourished in the heart of electronic music. His multi talented persona is Superman like; the quintessential businessman by day – running Plus8 Equity Partners and an iconic musician by night. John Acquaviva is the eye of the storm on an incredible hurricane. The techno icon’s strategic positioning along the electronic music spectrum as an inspired soul, rather than a hit maker, has made for one of the most exciting producers the community has ever experienced.
John Acquaviva was born in Orsara di Puglia, Italy and immigrated with his family to London, Ontario when he was just four years old. Fifteen years later, he was crowned #1 DJ by the best club in town – NOTORIETIES. A champion at song selection and beat matching, his innate talents assisted the then-burgeoning Acquaviva in cementing himself as a primary face of London and Southern Ontario’s music scene. Having him transcend from a “DJ’s DJ” to a techno stalwart in his own right. Acquaviva’s penchant for electronic music production has rewarded him a nearly four-decade-long career of excellence. This truth by his constant demand endorsed by the numerous clubs, festivals and promoters from Ibiza to Argentina that clamor for his performances.
 
John Acquaviva is a man who knows what he wants and has become a master attaining it. He is a musical polestar, a global iconoclast to those who admire his drive and a dedicated top-tier headline entertainer to his fans. On a technological level no DJ has made such significant contributions to the advancement of how DJ’s perform than John Acquaviva. His personal masterful technique and firm grasp of the trade led to his fruitful involvement with Final Scratch and especially Beatport. A vital founder and active member of both companies – the former tool that allows manipulation and playback of digital audio sources and the latter a major online hub for electronic music – John’s role extends far beyond his taste making capabilities.  He is a pioneer of electronic music’s technological evolution and helped sculpt the genre’s game-changing transition from analogue to digital and from vinyl to turntables and laptops. In sharing this vision with Richie Hawtin, they spearheaded a project that would act as the iTunes of dance, the duo arguably paved the path for a new and zestful era.
 
When Acquaviva and Hawtin became friends in 1989, the pair immediately co-founded Plus 8 Records in 1990, which capitalized on minimal releases from Cybersonik, Speedy J, Kenny Larkin and Plastikman, to name a few. It wasn’t until 1993, however, that he and Richie began to truly embrace their passions for house music by dishing up a second imprint – Definitive Records. Defined by a more progressive and tech house sound from such luminaries as Olivier Giacomotto, the imprint marked the beginning of John’s unparalleled taste as a global powerhouse and exemplar in dance music culture.
 
Bringing us to the present in  2015, Acquaviva proudly upholds the titles of zealous vinyl collector, insatiable entrepreneur, executive film producer and label owner. Yet above all, John Acquaviva is the quintessential performer at heart. His DJ career surging forward playing stellar sets at BPM Festival, Space Ibiza, Output in Brooklyn, Bellevue in Zurich and Crobar in Buenos Aires to highlight some of the past 12 months. He has penned electronic music’s prosperous novel, trailblazing the feast we comfortably sit at in the new millennium. With the imminent arrival of three forthcoming EPs, there’s no telling what evolution John will pull from his sleeve next.",16121,47,John,John Acquaviva,0,4562,user,2021-09-28T12:49:14Z,Acquaviva,25,3,jacq,https://soundcloud.com/jacq,2,,25,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/4562,soundcloud:users:4562,John Acquaviva,True,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:4562,artist-stations:4562,creator-pro-unlimited,soundcloud:users:4562,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:4784615', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000004562-bLMV5e-original.jpg'}]",,False,True,True,

His style is a hypersonic melting pot of cosmic house jams and hypnotic Detroit techno grooves.

Drawing inspiration from the astral arpeggios of 70s Krautrock, ragged Balearic vagabond synth pop of the 80s and proto-rave machine rhythms of the 90s.

Matt has dedicated his life to music - being a core part of New Zealand's dance music scene since the early 90s - touring around the leading clubs, festivals and venues, being a founding member of Nurture Recordings, running Crucial Records on Auckland's High Street, hosting Slipstream radio on George FM, running club nights such as Beatstreet, Energy Flash and Body Jack, alongside touring internationals alongside a technologist at Serato HQ and inMusic Corp.

--------------------------------------------------------

Musik Magier / Hannes Barthel born 1983 in Northern Germany, first got in contact with Psychedelic Trance in 1998. He was immediately hooked by the interesting shapes and colours of the sounds, driven by the powerfull grooves and rythms. It was immediately clear that he wants to produce that kind of music himself. So he started doing so in 1999.
Around 2002 a friend of him wanted him to remix a track and when Hannes Barthel asked him how he should implement that into Psychedelic Trance, the friend said „Well, you are the Musik Magier“. Without a Project/Artist name till then, Musik Magier was born.

He also found great interest in the technical side of audio. So developing the technical knowledge over the years went hand in hand with the creative side of music production.

Musik Magier always wants to produce and design interesting sounds for the synesthetic eye with underlining, driving, grooving bassline fundaments and rythm patterns. He also likes alot the idea of patterns that are more under the surface, that can be discovered for example while beeing in trance on the dancefloor.

Often experienced what dancing into trance can archieve. He likes to contribute to this experience with his music. Giving people on the dancefloor or party in general those magical experiences.

DJ / PRODUCER / REMIXER / LABEL OWNER 
JAMIE MCHUGH IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST TALENTS TO EMERGE FROM THE UK IN RECENT YEARS. HIS PRODUCTIONS HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY LAURENT GARNIER, MISS KITTTEN, SASHA, JOSH WINK, SLAM, JOHN DIGWEED, AND MANY OTHERS… IN A WORLD WHERE MUSICAL FASHIONS SEEM TO CHANGE ON A WEEKLY BASIS, MCHUGH STICKS TO HIS ROOTS, FUSING ELEMENTS OF HOUSE, ACID & TECHNO TO DEVASTATING EFFECT. 

From his time as a soldier with the British Army to becoming an in demand DJ & Producer, the rise of Jamie McHugh continues. He started DJing aged 18 before joining the Army and moving to Germany where he blagged sets at The Poison Club, Tribehouse and various other venues in the Dusseldorf area and anywhere he got the chance. In 2005 Jamie left the Army and moved back to London to concentrate on music production, and things really began to take off. 

Jamie's production and remix work has proved fundamental in driving him forward as both an artist and DJ. Radio 1 plays are a regular occurrence and he has been called upon to remix a plethora of acts including Josh Wink, Darren Emerson, Thugfucker, Tom Pooks, Meat Katie & D. Ramirez etc. Jamie takes pride in his work, sometimes spending months on a project before allowing it to see the cold light of day, he is not a disposable artist and he certainly can't be accused of churning out half baked productions on a weekly basis. In the current climate of randomly hurling releases at the schedule wall in the hope that something will stick, a McHugh release is more of an occasion. People actually sit up and take notice when he releases a record, as a result his tracks have caught the ear of the worlds leading taste makers. One of his many supporters Darren Emerson has already signed Jamie’s album to his Underwater imprint and featured three of Jamie’s works on his recent Global Underground compilation, whilst props from DJs that include Sasha, John Digweed, Laurent Garnier, Pete Tong and Slam amongst others have helped push Jamie’s sound around the world. 

In Feb 2008 Jamie released his debut artist album “Mind Games"" – a true testament to his hard work, the album featured on the DJ Mag hype chart for three months n a row and achieved high praise from the dance music press as well unrivalled support from the worlds leading DJs - Laurent Garnier, Miss Kitten and Sasha hammered the tunes while the remix package featured contributions from acts as diverse as Paul Ritch, Raudive and Jamie Stevens (Infusion), among others. 

As a DJ, McHugh has played all over the world in some of the most prestigious venues - from Centro in Jakarta, Indonesia to Gorod in Moscow, Russia. He has featured as a guest DJ on BBC Radio 1 and provided a cover-mount mix CD for I-DJ Magazine. Jamie’s technical skills are paramount, live loops and efx fill his sets, sponsored by Pioneer, he’s a shining example of the modern DJ, Time spent carefully selecting the finest elements of everything from deep techy sounds, throbbing basslines and darker twisted grooves, Jamie sculpts his soundtrack, managing to move with times whilst staying true to his acid house roots. 

Another string to his bow comes in the form of Variance Recordings which launched in summer 2007. Recognised as one of the labels to watch by Pete Tong, Variance has gone on to release compositions from both established producers such as Audio Soul Project, Raudive, Tom Pooks &, Agaric while also introducing the talents of Gary Beck, Harvey McKay and many others. Variance has enjoyed numerous Radio 1 plays and incredible support from some DJ's including Pete Tong, Laurent Garnier, Slam, Sasha, John Digweed, Adam Beyer, DJ T, Carl Cox etc 

Fast forward to 2009 and Jamie McHugh boasts a portfolio of achievments that demands attention, promoters and clubbers alike are tuned into his infectious grooves, his label is set for grandure and as his DJ Diary continues to grow with bookings all over the world in the coming months - the McHugh epidemic is spreading fast!

Largely influenced by Jeff Buckley, John Mayer, and Self’s Matt Mahaffey, CJ’s music features songs about the story of life – love, emotion, and the human experience.  He writes not only to entertain, but to inspire the listener with catchy melodies, passionate vocals, and relatable stories.

CJ’s EP, Fantasy World, was released in May of 2009 and features a mixture of interesting tales.  The title track, “Fantasy World”, journals the awkward time between childhood and becoming a world-aware teen. “Not This Time” began as an accidental guitar riff that came to have a song about overcoming temptations written around it. Taking inspiration from noticing the time every night for a week, “11:11″ is a love song inventing the mysterious magic of long-lasting love if kissing when all the numbers are ones.

While CJ has been playing and songwriting for 16 years, in 2008 he joined forces with drummer Jeremy Skowronski, bassist Taylor McRae, and guitarist/vocalist Michael Estok to begin performing his songs at various venues in Nashville.  Currently, CJ is performing acoustic-only shows all around the southeast with the help of guitarist, vocalist, and fellow artist, Michael Estok.",16,1,Christopher,Christopher Joel,0,4683,user,2013-07-25T03:18:17Z,Joel,0,0,christopher-joel,https://soundcloud.com/christopher-joel,2,,3,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/4683,soundcloud:users:4683,Christopher Joel,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:4683,artist-stations:4683,free,,,,,False,False,False,

Some were Holland natives, and others had come to attend local colleges and universities. While the original Holland nucleus has now dispersed to various parts of the country, the fellowship is still growing, with new friends and shared projects with other independent labels. Asthmatic Kitty is now based in Lander, Wyoming, Indianapolis, Indiana and New York City.

Asthmatic Kitty was named after Sara, a voluptuous orange and white longhair who wandered out of the woods in 1995, pregnant, starving, and afflicted with various parasites and ailments, including feline asthma. Although she still wheezes a bit, especially when being chased by her sister Tabby, Sara today enjoys a healthy and happy life of luxury.

From’s addictively catchy, simple pop songs sound like Nico + Kraftwerk on a Magical Mystery Tour. Brunn’s vocals are emotionally expressive while stylistically unaffected, bringing a refreshing, raw drive to surreal, eccentric orchestral arrangements. The live performances sound energetic, tight, and very loud, like an all night party far from any police stations.

From debuted with The American EP in 2006. The 6 track release was received with critical praise, and Brunn was eclectically compared to Nico, The Cure, and Madonna. The video for ""American Girl"" debuted in YouTube's top 40. In 2007, From released a single featuring a cover of R.E.M.'s ""Fall on Me"" as well as an acoustic version of its song ""American Girl.""

Later that year, Brunn relocated to Stockholm, Sweden, where she recruited musicians for a live band. In 2008, she moved back to Beverly Hills, where she completed From's first full length album.

Brunn grew up in Tel Aviv, Israel, attended high school in Beverly Hills, and graduated Harvard University with a major in economics. After college, she launched a line of high end handbags that sold in exclusive shops around the world and appeared in top fashion magazines, including Vogue, InStyle, and Marie Claire.  In LA, she created Math-Club, an organization that puts on recreational math events as documented in Time Magazine, Wired, and NPR. In her work as a web developer, she created sites for Ringo Starr and Justin Timberlake. She is a self taught musician who writes, performs, and produces all the recorded tracks for The Band From.",161,22,Roni,Roni Brunn,0,4838,user,2015-08-22T16:15:20Z,Brunn,29,1,thebandfrom,https://soundcloud.com/thebandfrom,1,,6,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/4838,soundcloud:users:4838,thebandfrom,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:4838,artist-stations:4838,free,,,,,False,False,False,

He started his career 20 years ago in New York City, throwing warehouse parties in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which at the time was a little known area, but his parties helped lay down the groundwork for nightlife in the now Brooklyn mecca. NYC press was taking notice and soon after, he was being featured in such publications as Interview, New York Times, Time Out NY & Village Voice. This eventually led to some of the biggest clubs in NYC booking Dub Gabriel, at places such as The Limelight, Twilo, APT, Cielo, Tonic, Knitting Factory and others. 

In 2005, he was offered a residency at Goya in Berlin, located at the original location of the notorious Metropol club & was built in a turn of the century opera house that survived two world wars. While living in Berlin, he toured continuously through Europe playing everywhere from anarchist squats to mega-festivals. 

In 2007, Dub Gabriel moved back to the States to San Francisco and in the following year he established his record label, Destroy All Concepts, a genre-defying label that was designed to be the home for various projects of Gabriel’s collaborations and productions. Highlight of guests include reggae legends, U-Roy, Ranking Joe & Brother Culture. Also, U.K. Dubstep pioneers, The Spaceape & Warrior Queen. And, world music giants, Master Musicians of Jajouka & Balkan Beat Box, as well as members of rock’s elite including Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Michael Stipe of R.E.M., David J of Bauhaus/Love & Rockets and Golgol Bordello vocalist/percussionist, Pedro Erazo. 

His albums have all been critic’s picks in the music press. Dangerous Minds says “Gabriel showing ultimate respect for the dubwise tradition as he seeks to launch it deep into this new century.” Billboard compared him to Brian Eno, XLR8R called his albums a “Philosophical Masterpiece” & Paste called it a “Kubrickian Soundtrack For Future Societies”. 

Besides his love for the studio, Dub Gabriel still finds time to keep an active touring schedule throughout North America, Europe and Asia. He has performed at such festivals as Outside Lands in California, Shambahala Music Festival in British Columbia and Fusion Festival in Germany to name a few.",9400,1990,Dub ,Dub  Gabriel,0,4841,user,2017-08-11T02:01:00Z,Gabriel,102,7,destroy-all-concepts,https://soundcloud.com/destroy-all-concepts,5,,29,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/4841,soundcloud:users:4841,Destroy All Concepts,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:4841,artist-stations:4841,free,soundcloud:users:4841,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:33252944', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000004841-vbzGRt-original.jpg'}]",,False,False,False,

Davem is an eclectic visionary artist. He comes from the world of skate/snowboarding culture. He wanted to become a professional freestyle snowboarder and in part, succeeded, but after a knee injury (now he does it just for passion), he had to take things slower. He tries to transform the tricks done on asphalt and snow in his art forms. He became a music producer through his enthusiasm and the constant research of new ways of communication, after venturing into painting and graphic art, preferring primitive and essential signs, which were sometimes inspired from a frail and tortuous inner exploration.

DAVEM grew up with hip hop, trip-hop, jazz, acid-jazz, and electronic music listening to every kind of music that is well made. He started to compose without any particular artistic inspiration, using just an impulse to create a sound with a strong personality. 

His way of working is very instinctive and dynamic. The creation of sounds sampled from the obscure situations of real life are important to his work. 

Davem is attracted and interested in collaborating with jazz instrumental musicians with an experimental open mind. For him music creation is a timeless magical moment, meditation. 

He attended the prestigious School of Saluzzo specialising as a technician of music for interactive digital arts. 

His ability to attract the attention led him to perform in some of the most important Italian festivals including Traffic Festival and Club to Club and Art Gallery. 

His eclecticism leads him to want complete sound with images. He wants to combine music and painting. His musical releases are complemented by its artworks printed on record covers.",258,478,XXX,XXX XXX,0,4858,user,2018-05-10T21:31:15Z,XXX,215,11,davemworks,https://soundcloud.com/davemworks,1,,12,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/4858,soundcloud:users:4858,DAVEM,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:4858,artist-stations:4858,free,soundcloud:users:4858,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:2663946', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000004858-Mh1Fgf-original.jpg'}]",,False,False,False,

ridiculously complex—exactly what you
want from minimal techno” 
Resident Advisor

Releasing a cluster of recordings for some of the most influential labels in the world (Cocoon, Rekids, Klang, Harthouse) has seen Deepgroove establish themselves as a force to be reckoned with amongst the legion hordes of globes techno devotees. Their partnership with legendary techno producer Jamie Anderson has led to a steady stream of innovative club destroying moments whilst they have continued to plough their own path through solo remixes and releases.

“With a 100% party attitude and a
keen ear for exactly the right tune
to devastate the dancefloor,
Deepgroove consistently smash it.”
DJ Magazine

Unstoppable rolling techno such as ‘Turbo’ for Cocoon Recordings have supplied suitably heavy ammunition for DJ’s like Sven Vath, Richie Hawtin, Carl Cox, Laurent Garnier and Dubfire to tackle their largest festival sets, whilst deeper material like ‘The Clock’ (for Rekids; with it’s subterranean Ben Klock Remix) provide incendiary underground grooves to fire up sweatbox after hours and sleazy night spots the world over.

“Proving that it’s still possible for real
talent to break through, the Deepgroove
boys have made the noughties their own.”
iDJ

The patronage of some of the worlds most respected flag bearers has led to bookings and a rapidly growing live show which has recently showcased for amongst others Bugged Out and Fabric.

“Book these guys and the only
way you’ll get rid of them
is to find them another party” 
DJ Magazine

Deepgroove and Jamie Anderson’s debut artist album “13MACHINES” was released on legendary German imprint Harthouse, (preceded by another firing 12” EP) allowing this white hot production team to expand the range of their grooves to cover late night burners, peak time club destroying moments and all that lies between.

‘Overt Maximal Tension…4/5 Mixmag’ ‘Unstoppable, Computer Says ‘Yes!’…4/5 DJ Magazine’ ‘Machine Soul Par Excellence…9/10 iDJ’

2011 sees Deepgroove further destroy dancefloors with their heavy beats and red-hot remixes of Piemont on MBF, Sei A’s massive ‘Lazers’ on Tiga’s Turbo Recordings, Paul Woolford’s acid workout ‘Pandemonium’, Tomas Andersson’s ‘Little White Lies’, X-Press 2, Jamie Anderson featuring Dave Angel on Artform, Max Cooper on Trapez, Bastards of Funk on Electrik Soul.

Look out for further singles on MBF LTD, Four:Twenty, Tim Sheridan’s VeryVeryWrongIndeed, Underwater (with new Hermanez Remix), and Rekluse. 

Also, coming soon, a compilation album on Harthouse and a remix album of their recent ‘13MACHINES LP’ with Jamie Anderson featuring Piemont, Minicoolboyz, Sei A, Daniel Steinberg and more...

 Since 1992 Romanto has been working as a DJ. For that time he developed a very special style of electronic dance music which is placed between Soul, Funk, Hip Hop, Electro and House. Meanwhile he counts to one of the busiest German DJs worldwide. Together with his mate Out Of The Drum a.k.a. Mario Zerfass he started to produce Funkin’ Electronical Beats in 1996. In the same year Romanto and Mario ...produced their first track “Smilin’ Faces”, released on Kosmomusic. “Smilin’ Faces” became an international dancefloor hit very fast. This success was the reason to keep on working on this level. After that the releases “From Da Backyard” and “Notes From The North” came out on Kosmomusic, followed by their first Album “Agent Style” on the same label in 1998. The enormous success of his productions led to a lot of international interest and enforced Romanto to special gigs like Berlin's E-Werk, the Loveparade, the MTV Air & Style Sunflower Festival and the Rave & Cruise or Frontpage Tour. But the highlight in the career of DJ Romanto was the DJ support for Jamiroquai's “Synchronized” tour.
After releasing the first album Kosmomusic published the single “Play It Again”. The track entered the German club charts and was sold out at once. This success showed that Romanto and Mario are on the right way in producing their own style.The follow-up “When I'm With You” appeared on a “Ministry Of Sound” compilation, other releases on labels like Beatmodul and Young Society. 
Up-to-date the second album “Six Leaves Left” will be released on Parasol Phonoteque. The influence of 60's and 70's soul music is as obvious as the inspiration by Hip Hop and Breakbeat of the 80's. Faced with the strong drive and the voluminous basses of modern House music the tracks create several pictures on your mind: Maybe Stevie Wonder appears behind the decks or breakdancers rave at the Love Parade. Perhaps Hip Hop artists rock on XTC or techno freaks are rapping in convertibles – The music of this album makes it possible!
Like on the debut from 1998 it was possible for Romanto and Out Of The Drum to engage well-known and international established artists. A few of them even join Tobias and Mario for the second time. MC B.A.G.I., who worked with Kool G. Rap or P.A., writes and speaks the lyrics in “4 Minutes To XTC”.

In 1996, he made his mark with his first hit El Cantor ""Toma"" on Digital Dungeon Records . This record became a LatinHouse club anthem across the world for months and peaked #9 on the Billboard Dance charts for several weeks . His success increased the demand as a Remixer/Producer on major & indie labels which landed his first commissioned dance remixes on Atlantic Records for The Gypsy Kings & Pet Shop Boys. This immediately propelled him into the mainstream. Popular artists, who wanted a presence in the clubs, like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, The Backstreet Boys, Enrique Iglesias, Gloria Estefan, Marc Anthony, Brandy, and many others, all sought Davidson out for his dance remix work.
In 1998, things paid off big going Platinum with 1 MILLION SALES for Ospina’s remix of Britney Spears, “Baby, One More Time” (Jive Records) . He also scored his first #1 hit with the chart topping remix of Christina Aguilera’s, “Ain’t No Other Man” (RCA) . Being a world renowned producer, has made Ospina a highly sought after DJ. Creating dance floor frenzies with his sets, you can find him playing at Huge Festivals such as PEX, Minus Zero and Burning Man.

Breaking through by winning a mix-tape competition for Renaissance and DJMag immediately placed Sonny right in the heart of Ibiza’s nightlife with high profile shows at Amnesia and Space, and a weekly residency at Manumission whilst capturing the attention of key industry press and aligning him alongside the likes of Nic Fanciulli in Mixmag as a ‘Future Hero’.
 
Sonny’s skillful ability to captivate the audience with his energetic performance and diverse track selection is what prominently positions him behind the decks of many of the world’s biggest clubs and festivals. Whilst sharing the bill with everyone from Laurent Garnier and Steve Lawler, to Armand Van Helden and Eric Prydz, Sonny consistently delivers on a global scale playing everywhere from Pacha, Sao Paolo and the Berlin Love Parade in Germany to London’s legendary Ministry of Sound and the iconic Glastonbury Festival. Holding international residencies at both Club Octagon in Seoul and Solidaritet in Stockholm, Sonny’s DJ career has been solid from the start.
 
With his unique and intricate production style, Sonny’s signature sound has been strongly supported by BBC Radio 1. Originally showcased by Annie Nightingale Sonny continues to receive regular rotation from Pete Tong, Annie Mac, Danny Howard and most notably Carl Cox who chose Sonny’s single “Raindance” as his ‘Ibiza Tune Of The Summer’ for Radio 1’s Review Show. It’s this level of tastemaker support that see’s Sonny release his music across a range of high-calibre labels and the catalyst to his long standing relationship with Brighton based Skint Records; a label that see’s him sit side by side with the likes of Dave Clarke, Tim Deluxe, and Tiga.
 
Year on year Sonny continues to expand on his creative capabilities and his now reputable capacity in the studio has seen him collaborate with X-Press 2, DJ Chus and Roland Clark whilst remixing for a broad array of artists including Morcheeba, The Temper Trap, Frankie Knuckles and Fatboy Slim who subsequently named Sonny as his “producer of the year” firmly strengthening his position within modern Dance Music today.

Their tracks have repeatedly topped international sales charts (Make Me Feel - #1 Beatport Electro, Can't Be Wrong - #1 Beatport Electro, Head Trick - # 1 Beatport All Genres & # 8 most downloaded track of the year) and have received chart action by the likes of David Guetta, Tiesto, Moby, and Diplo. “Head Trick” was one of the true dance anthems of 2008, a major crossover success becoming one of the most downloaded dance tracks of the year and receiving major play all across the globe. S&B followed the success of Head Trick with a number of critically acclaimed releases and remixes including a massive remix of Kaskade's No. 1 Billboard hit single “Move For Me”, a reworking of Larry Tee's “Louis Vuitton,” and their original single “Make Me Feel” which quickly became one of the summer anthems of 2009 with its chugging tech groove and sultry vocal hooks.

Since teaming up in 2003 Chris Santiago and Tim Bush have continually dropped EPs and remixes on some of the hottest labels around including Dim Mak, Cajual, Ultra, and have generated a signiﬁcant following in the process. During this time they have collaborated with some of the most well respected names in the game such as Om recording artist Colette and House music legend Green Velvet. Chris and Tim have worked with Colette on a number of projects including their hit single ""Make Me Feel"" as well as their epic remix of a Chuck Love's 'U R Everything' which was featured in Tiesto's March 2010 ""Club Life' international radio show. They also worked with Colette on her artist album ""Push"" for which they wrote and produced multiple songs including the album's single, ""If,"" which was licensed for an episode of Real World for ""MTV"" and can also be purchased as a ring tone from Verizon. February 2011 saw the release of “Give Something” on Potty Mouth Records, the long awaited follow up to Make Me Feel which again features the vocals of Colette over S&B’s party rocking beats. As of late Santiago & Bushido have been working closely with Curtis Jones aka Green Velvet and his with legendary record labels Cajual and Relief Records. They released their first single with Green Velvet titled ""Turn It UP “in early 2010 which was accompanied by a mind bending video featuring Green Velvet and S&B as disco invaders from outer space. The track quickly created a massive buzz receiving major radio play and support from all the usual suspects such as A-trak, Laidback Luke, and Afrojack among others. S&B have since released numerous remixes for Cajual including reworkings of La La Land and Harmageddon, and are poised to drop an original EP featuring vocal from Green Velvet on Relief Records in the spring of 2011.

As DJs Santiago & Bushido continue to draw inﬂuence from their Chicago house background while applying harder and heavier elements to their sound. Their unique live show features a dj set mixed with a live pa showcasing upfront tracks and a variety of originals re-edited and mashed together on the fly. Rather then stick to the traditional dj format Chris and Tim incorporate elements of their studio into their live show allowing them to create original crowd rocking sets by breaking down and building up their tracks in new and exciting ways. S&B are regularly headlining and appearing at some of the best parties in the US and beyond including Avalon (LA), Decibel Festival (Seattle), Bed (Miami), and Roots Society (Burning Man Festival). Recent shows have them playing alongside some of the hottest talent around today such as Deadmau5, Crookers, and Kaskade. Recent dates included a multi-city tour in Australia, multiple trips to Europe, and regular gigs throughout North America and Latin America.",6695,106,Chris,Chris Santiago,0,4957,user,2019-03-04T15:35:44Z,Santiago,41,1,santiagobushido,https://soundcloud.com/santiagobushido,5,,101,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/4957,soundcloud:users:4957,Santiago Bushido,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:4957,artist-stations:4957,creator-pro-unlimited,,,,,False,True,False,

His multicultural upbringing has shaped the
development of a truly unique sound. He performs a hybrid live set whereby he beautifully merges South American mid tempo grooves and Deep House sounds with shamanic rhythms and hypnotic frequencies. All this complemented by fractalised organic visuals to create truly immersive dance experiences.He takes dance floors to a deeper place, where you can explore
between the beats and lose yourself in the journey.
With the aim to bring more ritual to the dance music experience, he has
founded ALQUEM, one of London's most forward thinking nights.

Lu:sid has had the opportunity to share his music alongside amazing
international artists like M-RUX, Yokoo, Rodrigo Gallardo, Maugli, Kusht, Mira,
Sahalé, BéTé, Pigmalio, MoM, Chaim, Britta & Unders, Be Svendsen, Seth
Schwartz, Lannka, Eduardo Castillo, Uone, El Peche,
Atimos, Mardeleva, Jan Blomqvist and more.

You can also catch his other live project Sonic Enchantment. An immersive sound experience. Where he takes listeners into altered states of consciousness through sound.
