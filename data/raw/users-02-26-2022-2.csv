As longtime and wellknown DJ for House, UK Garage, D&B, or member of the one and only german 2step legend Gush Collective (with e.g. Matt Flores), labelchef of Draft Recordings and Metromusic, together with Cassique & M.Petit founder of one of the most favoured netlabels supafeed.net, or as him being part of the duo Westpark Unit (with Ingo Sänger), you won ́t find any german activist that did not own something out of the Herb LF Nordstadt FM studio. 
If you are searching for funk, soul, dub or jazz in modern clubmusic, Herb LF is the right one. In the meantime you can listen to that on more than 100 releases. 
Additionally he started the profession of Mastering the music of some artists & labels like Farside, Freude Am Tanzen, Musik Krause, Robag Wruhme, Kadebostan and of course nearly all of his releases and productions. It seems that this guy never leaves the studio... However he found time enough to present his DJ skills on countless gigs all over europe. 
For his latest project Discoshit he teamed up with Phil Decker from Sensual Touch Recordings. Together they will start soon a new vinyl and digital imprint called REST! Their new label will present artists like Discoshit, Elina Monova, Morgenklang and of course Herb LF himself.  

Es fällt schwer alle Aktivitäten und Produktionen von Herb LF in einem Info unterzubringen. Ebenso lässt sich Herb LF nicht ganz so einfach musikalisch festzurren. 
Als bestens bekannter langjähriger House, UK Garage oder Drum & Bass DJ, Mitglied der deutschen 2Step Legende Gush Collective (u.a. mit Matt Flores), Labelchef von Draft Recordings sowie Metromusic, zusammen mit Cassique & M.Petit Macher eines der weltweit beliebtesten Netlabels supafeed.net, oder als Teil des Westpark Unit Duos (mit Ingo Sänger), kommt man zwischen Düsseldorf und Dortmund um Produktionen aus dem Nordstadt FM Studio nicht herum. 
Wer den Funk, Dub, Soul und Jazz in der aktuellen Clubmusik vermisst, kann ihn bei Herb LF finden. Mittlerweile ist er auf mehr als 100 Veröffentlichungen zu hören. Als wäre das nicht genug für Studio Wizzard Herb LF, ist er mittlerweile auch Masteringexperte für u.a. Farside, Freude Am Tanzen, Musik Krause, Robag Wruhme, Kadebostan und selbstverständlich für die allermeisten seiner eigenen Veröffentlichungen. Trotzdem fand er noch Zeit genug, sich auf unzähligen Gigs in ganz Europa als DJ zu präsentieren. 
Für sein neuestes Projekt Discoshit tat er sich mit Phil Decker von Sensual Touch Recordings zusammen. Darüber hinaus werden die beiden in Kürze ein neues Vinyl & Digitallabel namens REST! starten. Die ersten Veröffentlichungen von u.a. Discoshit, Morgenklang, Elina Monova und natürlich von Herb LF selbst, sind bereits fertig produziert und erscheinen in Kürze.",2063,162,Herb LF,Herb LF,0,658,user,2020-04-30T21:12:52Z,,105,21,herb,https://soundcloud.com/herb,10,,54,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/658,soundcloud:users:658,Herb LF,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:658,artist-stations:658,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,soundcloud:users:658,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:14171661', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000000658-H6zY5K-original.jpg'}]",

Rocco’s career started in small underground Techno influenced clubs in Lyons, France, where he learned his trade alongside DJs like Laurent Garnier, Carl Cox, Louie Vega and DJ Deep.

After a stint in Portugal, Rocco teamed up with Alex Santos and Manoo in 2001 to form Rodamaal. 
The group quickly got a lot of attention and caught the ear of Ben Watt (from Everything But The Girl) who was starting his Buzzin’ Fly label at the time. Various EPs and singles for Buzzin’ Fly followed but it is the ‘Insomnia’ single - remixed by Âme - that is definitively the biggest single for Rodamaal, and it remains a Deep House classic.

While still working with his friends from Rodamaal Rocco started to release solo projects on various prestigious labels like Freerange, Defected, MN2S, Real Tone, and it is his single ‘Someday’, released on Real Tone - Franck Roger’s label - that propelled him as a major player status in the Deep House scene.
Following the success of these releases Rocco went traveling extensively all over the world spreading a unique sound combining Deep House, Minimal, Techno and Classic House.

Over the years Rocco has developed a huge following in South Africa, where it is not rare to see him perform in stadiums in front of 30,000-strong crowds. And it was on a South African label that Rocco released in 2013 his 'The Bridge' album, bridging indeed the gap between Europe, South Africa and the US and featuring collaborations between the French producer and artists and vocalists from South Africa and the US.

Rocco has been collaborating for a couple of years now with Klement Bonelli on productions and/or remixes and it is on Klement Bonelli’s own label Krome Records that Rocco released his vastly influential ‘TBT3’ track. Laurent Garnier, who had been supporting Rocco’s productions for many years, included it on his recent DJ Mag compilation. ‘TBT3’ is a milestone in Rocco’s career as it points toward the new musical direction Rocco and his soon to be launched label is exploring.

As innovative as the technologies he uses, in love with experimenting and having never enough of it, Andreino is a dj, a producer, an artist. 
The dj booth is his hyper technological laboratory where he, as some sort of cyber-alchemist manipulates sounds, mixing originality, rhythm and improvisation and

► Booking  & General Inquiries |  andy@alignrecords.com

Following the success of his most recent releases, including the hit single “Get On Up!” peaking at #6 on the official ARIA Australian Charts, the full stack recording artist, writer, producer, label owner is gearing up for a string of new releases – celebrating two decades since his debut “DISH” on Virgin Records.

A proud Filipino, Andy Roda was born in Copenhagen, graduated in New York City, now living in Berlin. Classically trained, he is a musician equally comfortable in jazz, soul, r’n’b – with roots in gospel, as singing weekly in his local church, was the nurturing ground during his childhood.

As a writer, Roda constructs his lyric accompanied dance [house] music in a traditional manner, and his versatile skills puts him in full control of his musical and visual output, mastering both music arrangement, production, and visual editing.

Since 2018 he has toured as a singer, dancer, actor in the hit show “BEAT IT” – a pop theatre musical based the life of the “King Of Pop” Michael Jackson across Europe, serving the role as “Acting Captain”, and substitute to “young Michael’.

The previous year he joined a star studded Danish cast in the theatre production of Susanne Bier’s Oscar nominated movie “Efter Brylluppet” (After The Wedding), directed by Peter Langdal.

Aside from his solo releases and theatre work, notable mentions are his tours as lead vocalist for platinum selling Danish Act Safri Duo, competing as the pioneering Filipino artist in the Eurovision Song Contest with his own song “Love Is Love”, as well as in Ed McMahon’s “Next Big Star” on American Television. He has opened for the Backstreet Boys, Spice Girls’ Emma Bunton, as well as written music for Asian boybands Mr. Tiger and S9F, and Philippines’ “Ultimate Showgirl” Vina Morales.

An advocate for his local communities, Roda co-founded the P-NOiSE Festival (A cultural exchange of Filipino Arts, Music, Dance and Film), which was mentioned in CNN, and has taken place across Copenhagen, Paris and Manila, supporting local and International artists.

With releases on Virgin Records, SONY, Kontor Records, as well as credible house music labels including Kingstreet, Simma Black, Tinted, Ibadan, Blacksoul, Milk & Sugar, Andy Roda continues to soar to new heights with his own label, ALIGN Records.

Their records ""Affenstunde"" (1971) and ""In den Gärten Pharaos"" (1972), played with the Moog III Synthesizer, are claimed to be fundamentally influencing works in Electronica. They went down in the annals of German film music history with their soundtracks for legendary cinema classics like ""Aguirre"", ""Fitzcarraldo"", ""Nosfeartu"" and ""Cobra Verde"" by German film director Werner Herzog. 

In the light of a current rediscovery of the 1970s Ambient- Electronica and German Progressive Rock movement featuring bands like Kraftwerk, Can, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze or Harmonia, Popol Vuh is now the 2nd band, being remixed by today´s Electronica avant-garde, including treats by Stereolab, Mouse on Mars, Peter Kruder (Kruder & Dorfmeister), Thomas Fehlmann (The Orb), Moritz von Oswald, A Critical Mass, Alex Barck (Jazzanova), Roland Appel, Mika Vainio (Pan Sonic), and Haswell & Hecker.

""Let the Music Move You . . .""

For over 30 years UNCLE DOG has been djaying and producing records in europe and around the world. Born and raised in London he was surrounded from an early age by every type of musical influence appealing to his hightened sensitivity.
As the house movement was born in europe Filippo was already djaying with pioneers such as Paul Anderson, Dave Dorrell, C.J. Mackintosh, Danny Rampling and Paul Oakenfold in the capital's underground ""temples"", Heaven, The Wag, Cafe de Paris, Enter the Dragon, Subterrania, Westworld, Sunrise, Future and even in MK's and the Sound Factory in New York and Pacia in Ibiza, Sharm el Sheik, Barcelona and Madrid.  He produced records for Virgin 10, Phonogram and FFRR under the name of The Universal Funk Industry and Love Inc.
In the early nineties he became jaded by the overcommercialisation of the underground house scene which he so loved and decided to move to Italy where he layed low until the new millenium when he decided to start djaying and producing again.

He works as a dj in Italy and Spain appreciated for his respect of quality dance music and his understanding of the underground music scene.  
His DJ sets ar transmitted regularly on Radio DeeJay, the most famous radio station in italy.

Since then, she ha been on a constantly evolving musical journey. In the early years, her sound was rooted in techno and landed most often on the label Brouqade Records, which she established in 2007. The label is still running too, and celebrated its 10th Year Birthday Celebration entitled 'Past/Present/Future' that emphatically encapsulated all that's great about the label. 
Aside from Brouqade, Dana's music has also featured on the liked of Autoreply, Work Them Records, Howl and Underground Quality. It was Jus Ed's label where she released her stunning debut album. 'Naturally' in 2014, an LP that introduced Dana to a whole new audience and showcased her pure house sound with some distinctions. In 2017 she started her new Label 'Cave Recordings' that showcased her wide musical range mainly rooted in House with old school flavor. 
When she isn't busy in the studio crafting textured tracks, Dana is a fine DJ who holds down resident duties at top Berlin space, Club der Visionaere. It is there that she lays down seductive tracks from the worlds of house and techno as well as gems in between. Aside from her beloved CDV, Dana has played in some of the globe's foremost house and techno nightclubs, often alongside some of the scene's prime movers and shakers.

He has played a pivotal yet covert role forwarding electronic music in Europe and beyond  - strengthening the ties between Rome (his hometown), Glasgow, Detroit and Rotterdam with his Final Frontier / Nature / Pigna stable of labels and to this day he continues to be an inspiration and educator for the younger generation.

Most of us come under the spell of the electronic cosmos sooner or later, but doing so at the tender age of 4 years rather seems highly exceptional. And even if this might appear almost impossible at first glance, this was indeed the case for young Christoph alias Click | Click, when he heard Kraftwerk for the very first time on the radio back then. Therefore, it is no surprise that this experience was going to change his life significantly.

His name thereby originates from his earliest musical roots when he was still forfeited to the more minimal sounds of Techno and in which time he also started his first own label Kassette Records in the year 2006. And even if much has happened since and a lot changed musically, Click | Click always remained true to his roots by keeping his name. Through his musical transformation from Minimal Techno to Jackin' House, also the labels changed in the course of time, on which we have been able to pursue his musical talent over the years.

In 2013, he already established his second labels Palms & Flamingos, meant to provide room for exactly such projects, which had developed over the years. Of course it did not take long, until many reputable labels of the scene got wind of his artistic refinement. Like this, Click | Click already put out numerous releases on imprints like Green Velvet/ Cajmere's Cajual, Shir Khan's Exploited Ghetto, Mihalis Safras' Label Mr. Carter/ Material and Riva Starr's Snatch! Records, which not only lead to countless chart positions on relevant platforms, but also caused further international interest in his music.

Productions like Teenage Killerfunkband (2010), Ducks In The Kiddie Pool (2013), Girls Girls Girls (2013), The Muzic Box (2015) or Birdhain (2017) made their way into the crates of scene pioneers like Magda, Jamie Jones, Green Velvet or Claude VonStroke. This diversified and respectable appreciation of his creative doing naturally provided him with numerous national and international performances in the best clubs and most important festivals of the world as well.

Like that, he already played in such reputable venues like the Watergate Berlin, Ministry of Sound London or D-Edge Sao Paulo, as well as the meanwhile relocated to Portugal BPM Festival Mexico or the Monarch/ Great Northern in San Francisco. Also his successfully completed tours through varying countries like Brazil, Mexico, USA, China, South Korea or Thailand make unmistakably clear, that the name Click | Click should not be forgotten too quickly.",14737,101,Booking:,Booking: kristin@kassette-records.com,0,829,user,2020-12-16T21:19:06Z,kristin@kassette-records.com,272,20,clickclick,https://soundcloud.com/clickclick,40,,98,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/829,soundcloud:users:829,Click | Click,True,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:829,artist-stations:829,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,True,soundcloud:users:829,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:67859869', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000000829-RM9e0X-original.jpg'}]",

Will Saul has been at the cutting edge of electronic music for nearly 20 years now. He has released well over 150 records across his two labels - Aus Music & Simple Records - from the influential likes of Joy Orbison, Carl Craig, Pearson Sound, Leon Vynehall and Actress, as well as EPs that helped to break the careers of talents like Bicep, Dusky, Midland and George FitzGerald. This visceral A&R ability has seen him become head of A&R at !K7, responsible for all artist signings and in charge of curating the hallowed DJ Kicks series. Unearthing new and exciting artists and music is Will's lifeblood and something he has been doing every day for as long as he can remember. Will started working in music aged 19 - work experience during university led to a full time role as A&R with Sony Music. He left Sony to set up his first label Simple whilst becoming part of the team that founded the legendary Phonica Records in London.
As an artist in his own right his music and remixes have been critically acclaimed and seen him featured on the cover of DJ magazine and helm the Essential mix for Radio 1. Will has been trusted to remix a diverse range of incredible artists from Little Dragon to Kelis via Pearson Sound and Fink and has released many singles and EPs (on labels such as Kompakt and !K7 as well his own) as well as two full length artist albums - the last of which was his CLOSE project - which saw him tour a live audio visual show (with a drummer) which debuted in room 2 of Fabric.

Will is an experienced DJ and has held residencies at some of the best clubs in the world (The End in London, Studio 80 in Amsterdam and a label residency at Fabric to name a few) and plays/played (some are now closed) regularly at the likes of Panoramabar, Robert Jonson, Trouw, Yellow and Labyrinth Festival. Will has contributed entries to two of the most respected commercially released mix series out there in DJ Kicks and Balance - both of which made it into Resident Advisors best 20 compilations of the year.

BIO:
Gioele Giacopelli as JWL is an Italian DJ and producer. He began to love music since he was only a kid, thanks to the domestic environment. His 360 degrees musical groundwork has been settled first by his parents (dad is a bass player and mum a great singer) who introduced him to artists such as Stevie Wonder, Pino Daniele and others from the 70’s and 80’s. When he started “walking with his own legs” and so creating a proper knowledge of different musical genres and artists, JWL discovered to have a big feeling for the Afro-American music culture (Soul, R’n’B, Funk, Jazz, Hip Hop, and so on) losing himself into the local hip hop scene. 2000 marks the first JWL's approach to the dance culture: he began to listen to some Masters At Work's productions and he was delighted about that sonority called House. Afterward, he bought his first console and started to collect vinyl records. In the following years, Gioele enriched his dance culture attending constantly at Red Zone Club in Perugia and it was fundamental for his growth. In 2005 he setted up his own studio and started producing music, gradually stepping in the Perugia underground scene, supported by various DJ's, among which Ricky L and Sauro Cosimetti. 2011 marks for JWL his first digital release of his track “Hot Love” on the American label ""Plus Plus"". In September of 2012 he remixed Double Beat's track ""The Sense Of Truth"", released on ""Soul Shift Music"". After that, he made a track called “The Whistle Track” released on “The Yellow Drumachine EP” (Adult Dance Music) and in February of 2013 he made a remix of Joy Lee and Speakdeep's track ""Geist"", out on “Mind Your Hate”. JWL’s remix of Joy Lee’s track “On The Road”, released in November 2013 on “Sexonwax”, has preceded the turning point in his career, his first vinyl release on the Umbria-based label “Fortezza Records” with a track called “Little Theme”. This track, belongs to a banging four tracker EP featuring artists such as Mass Prod and Rufus, Giovanni Ferretti and Speakdeep. This EP was supported by a lot of Italian and international artists, for instance Mister G and Boyd Jarvis. In June 2015, JWL signed another important vinyl release on the UK label “Phatway Traxx”. This EP named “The Disco Cuts EP”, was first in many charts and the JWL’s track “Again’n’Again, contained on the b-side, it was supported by big artists like Ben Ufo. In 2016, he became part of the Berlin-based label “Soundscapes Records/Escape Series” and signed a four tracker EP in collaboration with the Tuscany musician and producer “INNO”. This amazing EP will be released on vinyl in the next months. JWL has performed in many important clubs such as “KaterBlau” (Berlin), “Red Zone Club/B-Side” (Perugia), “Serendipity/Rec Room“ (Foligno), “DOT Club” and important festivals as “Collective”, “SoundOf”, “Terni Factory”, “Interleave” and so on.

In the ‘90s, Holder began producing his own tracks and released 12”s for a number of labels like Definitive, Stickmen, his own imprint DNH, and !K7 (which released his first two full-length albums One Night in the Disco, and Back On Track).  Furthermore, Holder released many of his productions through NRK Sound Division, including many of his biggest hits such as ""I Once Believed in U"", ""Trying to Find Myself"" and ”Da Sambafrique"", in addition to full-length efforts From Within, Underground Alternatives, and The Other Side. 

Upcoming in 2016, look out for numerous releases on his label DNH under both Holder’s own name, as well as his Trackheadz alias.  Nick has also recently launched his own radio show DEEP SECTION, which is broadcast every Wednesday night at 8-10pm EST on VIBE 105.5 in Toronto and online at www.vibe1055.com.

Growing up in 1980s Los Angeles, he was initially inspired by radio mixshows and djs such as: Doc Martin, Rob One, Michael ""Mixxin"" Moore, and 1580 KDAY Mixmasters. Moving to San Francisco in 1992, he immersed himself in its underground scene. Attending parties lead to working them and eventually to djing. He played his first warehouse in 1996 and spent the next 10 years djing and producing some of San Francisco’s most infamous parties and club nights.

""Gold Code"" was initially founded as a music blog in 2007. The site showcased past, present, and future classics and as well as his personal edits and dj mixes. 

In 2009, he focused his efforts on music production and a live show. He adopting ""Gold Code"" as his moniker and debuted a well-received live set at the celebrated “As You Like It” parties. Remixes soon followed for Nude Photo Music and SubSensory labels culminating with his debut release, ""The Day After"" with remixes by Audioelectronic, Basskittens, Chris Fierenze, and Jonah Sharp.

Jimpster Biography 

Taste-maker, label boss, producer, DJ, remixer. Jamie Odell wears many hats and wears them well.

Under his Jimpster alias, he has become one the most revered deep house producer/DJs operating on the scene today.  His esteemed labels Freerange and Delusions of Grandeur continue to help break incredible new music and equally impressive acts such as Detroit Swindle, Tornado Wallace and Session Victim.  From his UK base, Jimpster has inadvertently become a standard-bearer and custodian of the authentic house sound, and carries this flag to the four corners of the world.
 
As he puts it: ""House music has been my first love and passion since hearing 'Strings Of Life' for the first time at The Essex Barn in 1988 and I'm still inspired by the memories I have of that period when the whole electronic music scene was so fresh and exciting as well as being really broad and eclectic.  One minute we were listening to Lil Louis' 'The Story Continues' and the next, freaking out to 'Radio Babylon' by Meat Beat Manifesto.  Every track seemed to have its own strong identity and unique sound and I guess that ethos is something I try and carry through to my A&R for the labels.  Certainly as a producer I am still striving to produce that perfect house track which will stand the test of time in the same way that those early classics have.  The blueprint is simple: to inject life, depth, soul, sincerity and attitude. This is what sets the players apart from the pretenders.  That challenge is what keeps me focused and inspired 25 years on and I'm sure it will keep me on my toes for the years to come.""
 
His seminal LP 'Messages From The Hub' established Jimpster as an artist of note back in the late 90’s and the music has flowed steadily and consistently since then, mostly on Freerange, with the 2006 excursion 'Square Up' on Ben Watt’s Buzzin Fly label proving to be a (temporary) transfer of one London-based deep house icon to another.
 
Releases such as 'Dangly Panther', 'A Love Like This' and 'Can't Stop Loving' continue to be choice cuts for many DJ's whilst 'These Times' and 'Porchlight And Rocking Chairs', two more recent deep house anthems, were remixed by Dixon and KiNK to serious effect.  2015 shows absolutely no signs of slowing down with the 'English Rose' EP arriving on Freerange in early summer and a new hook-up with Berlin’s Suol label kicking off with a remix of Till Von Sein’s 'Booty Angel'.  It continues with the Jimpster original 'Last Days of Summer' which is due mid summer.
 
Sterjimp? His current stat count as a remixer is touching a century and the acts to receive his midas touch includes everyone from Osunlade (“Mommas Groove” still being hammered by Moodymann on a regular basis), Solomun, Kollektiv Turmstrasse and Josh Wink ('Jus Right' stole the show at Dixon's 2015 Detroit Movement set) through to Bob Marley, Seal and Terrence Parker.  Recent remixes for Detroit Swindle, Paxton Fettel and Da Posse all show that the inspiration is still flowing thick and fast.

As we head deeper into 2015, with Jimpster still doing the business at globally renowned hotspots like Fabric, Air and Watergate, a slew of new music on the way, the ideas flowing freely and with over two decades of experience to draw on we see clearly that the fire is still burning as brightly as ever.

About me:
    i just got this lovely message from one of my true faith listeners which pretty much sums up what it's all about in a few words. no further info needed. Thanks, Evelyn

    ""I think that there are some DJ that just spin music like they are alone in their rooms,
    never taking the time to take a moment and share the real feeling of what good music is.
    For those kind of DJ's music is about ego. But then their are DJ like you, who hear good music
    and want to share it among friends. A great DJ hears a good tune and wants to run around and tell
    the world how great it is. For me your show is more about bringing all listeners together in a world
    groove. Thank you Mr Rutten for shinning your brilliant light to my and everyone of your listeners worlds :)""

Since near 25 years, Loulou and Pollux are LuLúxpo: an inseparable and singular couple that looks like two characters who escaped from an interstellar comic-strip. LuLúxpo is therefore a fusion of two multidisciplinary artists. The duo of contemporary visual artists is influenced by pop-art and fashion. Together, they perform as electro DJs who have fallen from the sky and set fire to every dance floor they attend to. Their “four hands” sets are always memorable. Their motto: Love is Power!

Launched in January 2007 on Couleur3/RTS (Swiss national radio), LuLúxpo has its own radio show called Let’s Dance. It now airs on Radio Meuh (www.radiomeuh.com) since september 2017. 

Still in 2017, they launched their own record label: @ParadiseChildrenRecords: https://paradisechildrenrecords.bandcamp.com/.

Leur leitmotiv: Love is Power! 

En janvier 2007 sur Couleur3/RTS (Swiss national radio), le couple donne naissance à Let's Dance, une émission de radio 100% Pink Electro.  Cette émission vogue depuis septembre 2017 sur les ondes de Radio Meuh (www.radiomeuh.com).

He started on the wheels of steel at the age of nine, and certainly made a contribution on the House scene in Chicago. He performed with some of Chicago’s luminaries, such as Armando, Ron Carroll, Boo Williams, Paul Johnson, Andre Harris, Mark Grant, and Glenn Underground, just to name a few. Inspired by Chicago’s definition of House, he accumulated his own unique style. DJ Fritz can move the crowd in more ways than one, as he strives to make more and more music. DJ Fritz has consistently played at some of Chicago’s infamous old and new school underground clubs. Having been a part of the House scene for over two decades, DJ Fritz has mastered the art of DJ’ing locally and internationally. 
As a producer, DJ Fritz produced his own tracks and remixed old school favorites like “Love You More” by Genuine, “New Day” by Patti LaBelle, and “O” by Omarion. In 2000, DJ Fritz created Muzic Vision Records with DJ Papa, with the following mission: to create, produce, remix, and play unique music that combines jazz, gospel, house, lounge, and other soulful qualities. With this in mind, Muzic Vision Records released “African Orchestra,” “Brighter Day,” and “The Journey Home” with last releases from Glenn Underground titled “Inner Techno” and “Ambient Jazz 1.” Muzic Vision Records established itself, and DJ Fritz continued to work on projects, and spinning at major nightclubs. He then moved on and collaborated with DJ Pap to form Naked Soul, which released nothing but soulful grooves. Later, more entities were created, such as Black Mamba, which is their African tribal grooves, and Gamma Kids, where you will hear more of the techno beats. 
DJ Fritz’s music, producing, and remixing styles reflect the deep sounds of the soulful House in Chicago. He has a number of singles and EPs supported by Citrus Recording and Cameo Recording in the UK, Lad Records in Portugal, United Music Records in France, Music Plan Records in Italy, and his own label, Muzic Vision Records. DJ Fritz creates and produces sounds that blur the lines between genres and connect the dots for his listeners. He is still highly involved within the House scene in Chicago and is currently, working on several tracks, which will soon be released. Through creativity, ingenuity, and a genuine message, DJ Fritz and Muzic Vision Records will continue to take music to a higher standard throughout the world.

Nestling somewhere between the sideways slant of a sepia Sunday morning and the electrostatic seduction of a Saturday night, Tim has carved out a cultural niche that is his, and his alone. His original productions range from the jaw-droppingly original (It’s a Fine Line – Woman), to the heartbreakingly sublime (Tim Paris – Outback, Stones & Vinyl), and his remixes (the XX; Silicone Soul; Salif Keita; Telepop Musik) reflect his unique musical position.  Tim’s label, Marketing Music, has quietly gone about releasing some of the most innovative and gloriously confounding electronic house music of the past decade, and his collaboration with ex Black Strobe bohemian Ivan Smagghe, It’s a Fine Line, has borne fruit, after juicy fruit. Dancers, his first full-length release, was signed by Canadian label My Favorite Robot and is an astonishing piece of work. Switching effortlessly from metallic electro purring, to slack-jawed new-wave disco, to shimmering, bewitching, house, it marks a new high point in a career rammed full of them.",8763,254,tim,tim paris,0,939,user,2022-02-18T16:20:50Z,paris,173,10,tim-paris,https://soundcloud.com/tim-paris,5,,66,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/939,soundcloud:users:939,Tim Paris,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:939,artist-stations:939,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,soundcloud:users:939,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:955087', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000000939-9KKUwU-original.jpg'}]",

From the outset, his early productions on Hypercolour UTTU and Ultramajic showed incredible depth and dance floor sensibilities, frequently mastering that difficult line between genres that producers seek, but often fall short of (and often sounding contrived when trying). His vinyl-only label series “Bodytrax” (which he proudly runs with the Clone.nl crew in Holland) is an ongoing outlet for these productions; one that ebbs and flows through his passion for creating what he feels like organically and not what’s being hyped at the time. Drawing on his years of experience as a DJ and not being one to settle simply for “getting the job done”, his output is renowned for being incredibly effective and standing out in the sets of DJs the world over, with his music consistently featured on Radio 1 shows and essential mixes. In 2016, he dropped his critically “Cobra Effect EP” on DEXT which was championed by the likes of Black Madonna and Jackmaster, which led to an invitation by legendary pioneers Leftfield to remix ""Song Of Life"" on their historic 22 Year Anniversary re-release of “Leftism” in 2017. He also explored collaborations including “Hotshot” with long-time supporter Paul Woolford aka Special Request, and his new “Duel Series” which kicked off in late 2019 with Berlin legend Fiedel.

On the performance side, his early days saw him as a DMC DJ Championship competitor, and then cutting his teeth worldwide as a techno DJ (including a residency at the UK's largest and most respected parties “Atomic Jam” in Birmingham). His lifelong obsession with seeking out and collecting music has also paid off in spades in the form of his vast record collection, which he explores with mixes and shows he has produced for the likes of Radio 1, FACT, Mixmag, DJ Mag, and Rinse FM. Armed with these experiences and credentials, he is known as a technically skilled and incredibly intuitive DJ, taking risks where they count and never playing the same set twice. Tapping into his love affair with music and working the floor, he prides himself in being able to play pretty much anywhere, be it techno, electro & EBM in the main rooms of Berghain or Fabric, jacking Chicago and acid house alongside the originators in the “Dancemania Mixmag Lab”, or electronica & beyond supporting Leftfield on their Leftism 22 UK arena UK arena tour in 2017.

These were the years of the “new wave” / “electro funk” / “garage” / “house” of the 90s, and Alex quickly became well known across the leading clubs across the globe.
Alongside his DJing successes, he melted efforts with his business partner Marco Baroni to build the brand Kamasutra with releases that were felt on a global scale.
In 1999 Planet Funk were born and with their first single “Chase the Sun” they emerged at the top of global charts, and subsequently various albums and singles of equal success and industry acclaim. The band has released a total of 5 albums plus a “Best Of” and is currently releasing its sixth album.
Alex Neri has collaborated with the notable Tenax Club in Florence in starting the record label “Tenax Recordings”, acclaimed both by the public and the music industry. The first single, “Housetrack”, released in 2004 won the Siae prize for being the most sold album from an independent label.
Tenax Recordings has showcased a myriad of well known DJs and Italian producers like Federico Grazzini, Ilario Alicante, Luca Bacchetti, Philipp&Cole and many more.
While Alex continues to produce, he also works on various remixing projects for many international and local artists.

Au-delà des modes, il réussit avec brio à synthétiser toutes ses influences pour offrir des sets de grande qualité. Son parcours musical lui a permis de jouer dans des clubs à renommée internationale, tel que le Rex de Paris, le Wood de Bruxelles, le Pudel Club de Hambourg , le Hive de Zurich ou encore Weetamix à Genève en compagnie de Djs comme Agoria, Ame, Sascha Funke, Mathias Kaden, Marshall Jefferson, Minilogue pour en citer que quelques-uns.

Being a producer, Dj and collector of rare Italo-Disco vinyls, he is on the very front of the exploding Disco movement in Europe with his “Italo Deviance” Blog and Label.
Marcello started djing back in 1992 when starting what would have been the golden age of the House Music scene.
He began playing in clubs nearby his town and at 20 become resident-dj of the historic Italian party called ""Les Folies the Pigalle"" which at the time was one of the points of reference for the National dance music and this allows him to have a high visibility and work in the best italian club's network. His vocation as a producer it's easy to feel and at 21 bought his first equipment and released a debut E.P.
Then he signed with labels like Dirt Crew, Players Paradise, Mule Musiq, Endless Flight. For more than a decade remains anchored to a pure ""underground sound"" and gives all importance to the music quality. His inspiration comes straight from the N.Y. Disco scene (Paradise Garage) an mid '80s Chicago House scene like Muzic Box and Warehouse but also from the early 80's Italo Disco and Cosmic.
Marcello also founded, back in 2008, an highly disco oriented blog called Italo Deviance and the self-named label.
After the blog success Marcello started djing in many places around the world (Tokyo, NY, Philadelphia, Helsinki, Oslo, London, Berlin, Barcelona, Madrid, Athens and many more) he also works at prestigious events related to fashion brands and magazines as: MaxMara, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, D-Squared, Henrietta Ludgate, GQ Magazine.",9114,128,Italo Deviance /,Italo Deviance / Marvin & Guy,0,978,user,2022-02-11T11:42:58Z,Marvin & Guy,138,0,marcellogiordani,https://soundcloud.com/marcellogiordani,17,,151,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/978,soundcloud:users:978,Marcello Giordani DJ,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:978,artist-stations:978,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,,,,

Empro und Sven sind zwei Prachtexemplare, die sich vor nicht all zu langer Zeit erst gefunden haben. Empro ist DJ und unterhält einige einschlägige Tanzveranstaltungen, wie die Home-Sweet-Home-Party in Berlin und den Sleepless-Floor auf dem Melt!-Festival. Sven äugt dagegen virtuos und leidenschaftlich durch sein Ableton-Arrangement-Fenster und kann sich das Auflegen deswegen schon nicht verkneifen. Gott sei Dank, dass er das auch sehr gut beherrscht. Beide sind sich wohl in einem Bar25-Sommer näher gekommen, während gemeinsamen Marathon-DJ-Sets und beim sich gegenseitig Konfetti in die Unterhosen stecken. Dabei muss ihnen die kongeniale Sonne aufgegangen sein, die das Produkt „Empro & Jozwiak“ so erfreulich gedeihen lässt. Soundfreak Sven pflanzt hier ertragreiche Drum-Machines in Empros fruchtbaren Studiokompost, dessen Zentrum sich mit seismographisch nachvollziehbaren Basswellen über den Prenzlauer Berg erhebt und im anliegenden Upon-You-Büro für freundlich schielende Gesichter sorgt. Fleißige Geistesschwaden verhängen hier die Tageszeiten, Subfrequenzen drehen die Neonröhren aus der Fassung und am Ende kommt bei den beiden dann ein neues Liedchen raus.

The earliest origin of rhythmic drum objects and talking drums of the motherland, to the brand new long player from Vienna’s finest electronic drum ensemble Makossa and Megablast. Welcome to ‘Soy Como Soy’.
In 2007 the duo along with a host of talented singers and musicians created quite a stir with their debut album ‘Kunuaka’, on G-Stone recordings, receiving high praise from musical luminaries such as Gilles Peterson, Carl Craig and Laurent Garnier.  Everybody mentioned that the production sounds were tight, precise and sharply exact. DJ’s couldn’t get enough of ‘Kunuaka’. Even more so, taking it to the stage on too many festivals to mention they cemented a formidable following and fan base. Along on the ride on these live tours came the very vocalists and percussionists that appeared on the album. It is one of the main sensations from the new album ‘Soy Como Soy’ and its predecessor ‘Kunuaka’ is the fact that ‘live’ means ‘live’, the flow, the origin from the primordial drumbeat and vocalists participating with the drum.  It is like a heartbeat, quite unique.
That was then, this is now…
So the good times on the beach festivals and the worldly travelling has to come to a stop! Time to return to the Luv Lite studies in Vienna to get down to the ‘nitty gritty’ of classic retro analogue knob twiddling! Finding the freshest and most innovative musicians and vocalists, and ‘getting it down’ is a pain-staking venture at best. 
Those days and those travels of playing in front of 30,000 happy smiley people on a beach come into play though (thankfully). Experiences, states and situations, the emotions and the sensations of the last four years! Well, Makossa and Megablast do a fantastic job of applying them to ‘Soy Como Soy’. The guys have come home, and are better for it. Sounds are even tighter, more precise and exact. Vocalists illuminate the scenes and the songs.  From the massive anthem beat driven ‘Soy Como Soy’ picked up by the big dicks in just about every dance orientated genre to the beautiful tranquillity and quietude of ‘Love You’, the album indefinitely goes forth. You can definitely hear that the guys have done some serious travelling and met some fine folks along the way. Tracks like ‘If I U Me’ and  ‘Release The Pressure’ ooze with layers of emotion and mood of reflection. The climate changes with the magnificent ex ‘Tower Of Power’ singer Hubert Tubbs on two stunning tracks ‘Coming Home’ and ‘Peace’. You feel his guts when he sings, seriously, his voice is imposing and beyond the norm. OG Spiritual Godess from Zimbabwe and Cleydys Villalon from Cuba make sure the girls get their say too with somewhat strikingly exotic vocals. ‘Imimi’ and ‘Bailalo’ two tracks for me that rouse and quicken the senses with much exhilaration and gladdening. You can tell that Megablast works closely with the vocalists directly in the studio. The interaction of the human elements is firm and resolute and always convincing. These are not vocal parts sent over Internet, they are direct in the presence of the production team in the Luv Lite lounge and studios. Overseen too by Makossa’s more than keen ear, having the ability to recognize and draw the fine distinctions in sound, he is indeed the acute observer.
Suspenseful trippy analog synths and other tinted sounds, the scrupulous drums, percussion and forceful basslines, all nicely inconspicuous from their travels and their tales. A real a fusion of organic Afro-Latin beats.
Makossa and Megablast have come home finally, we missed them very much. We’re very happy to have them back. (Alan Brown, Soul Seduction, Vienna)

I started producing music on an Ensoniq EPS Sampler in my teens by sampling sounds to create my own sounds and had so much fun on that syth/ sampler. Then later moved to the computer world of using Logic and later Abeton Live which I use as my main studio software. My main instrument of choice is keyboards/ piano which is where it started back when I was 3 and what I use for my midi recording. Yet I have also been a past metal and grunge guitar extraordinaire, okay not exactly, but that's what some kids at school used to say, so I'm going with it! And been known to surprise peeps with my drumming skills. 

I've also been DJing for a darn long time when Turntables were the only option, so I prefer the real vinyl feel of DJing music where possible and use Traktor Scratch Pro so I can play any tune using timecode vinyls which feel so darn real, yet also DJ with CDJs and USB set ups and using Traktor. I've DJed at clubs, radio stations, Raves, underground events, Conventions and house parties which happen to be my fav events to play at cos they are smaller and fun and often such like minded people where the funniest stuff happens and if the floor boards are making your turntables jump from all the happy dancing, everyone thinks it's part of the set. ;)

I have created music for software, video games, DJ mixes and various other media. I have a dream of making music for animation as in something you would see on tv, on Netflix or something bigger than You Tube.

The crowd respond at every turn."" - Steve McLay, DJ MAG
Always sitting slightly off-centre, Jay Tripwire is an artist that walks the line as industry staple and ever changing innovator,
releasing one standout release after another.
His signature fusion of deep Detroit textures and intricate rhythms has led a career spanning two decades,
with over 200 vinyl releases, 2 commercial mixed cd compilations, and four full length albums.
He remains one of the most prolific artists around, with an average of 15 releases per year.
He is an always an in demand remixer he averages 10-15 remixes per year.
In 2010 Jay Was honoured by being named by Future Music alongside Frankie Knuckles, Larry Heard, Charles Webster,
Atjazz, and Tom Middleton as being one of the most influentual Innovators in house music for “The thoughtful minimal stylings of Jay Tripwire.”
Most recently he’s completed a compilation mix for Steve Bug’s respected label Pokerflat –
‘Shaping Elements Vol.8’ which features a blend of deep house ranging from
Detroit inspired textures to modern European house and tech house fusions,
blurring genrefication. This follows releases on the label under his 8Channels name - a project that melds basic channel,
cosmic soul and dub into a new hybrid soundscape of techno, deep house and dub.
The moniker also appears on other highly regarded labels such as Ransom Note, Conya, NRK, Cinematic and Hallucination.
Whilst the term ‘legendary’ is often bandied about with little thought,
in Jay’s case we could say just that - his personal arsenal of re-edits and comfort in arranging extended DJ sets lasting eight hours or
more certainly demonstrates a talent that deviates from standard fare.
Jay also still supports,buys and plays vinyl, and actively seeks out records to play at gigs, when Tripwire is on the decks he plays a vinyl
and CD set.
Jay has made appearances in over 200 cities worldwide, and some of his most memorable gigs have been a decade of bookings at
Fabric London- a venue that has changed his approach to Djing, and production sound.
Jay’s work has been featured on numerous compilations, notably from Cocoon, Fabric, Renaissance, Journeys by DJ, Ultra & Bedrock,
and is supported by a diverse spectrum of dance culture from house luminaries
such as, Doc Martin and Kerri Chandler to techno legends Steve Bug and Laurent Garnier and John Digweed
With anticipated releases and remixes imminent, the Tripwire production wheel is still very much in motion,
and on its way to a turntable near you.

My dear Friends,
we have been active on Soundcloud for 12 years now. Since the first beta we supported this wonderful project. Unfortunately Soundcloud has changed a lot. Since there are no more groups To us SC feels like frozen. The advertising is more annoying than on Spotify - even though we pay  for it!  Our visitors are mostly good old Friends. Most of them - like on reverbnation - are also musicians. Don't get me wrong, SC is a great Place to communicate with other musicians but not so much for promotion nowadays.
. 
Many of you spend a lot of time and energy in collecting likes and comments here - but what for if no ""real"" listeners come by? You work for soundcloud many hours a month, pay for it and have to listen to their addspots, too - crazy!
Soundcloud is offering a monetization similar to Spotify for a while now, when you become a pro-member. However, you need at least 1000 plays a month and come from the ""right"" country to participate and only a few reach that number every month.

We have compared the number of  plays for some of our current tracks:

Cum Ex on SC 686 on Spotify 4131
Cum Cum on SC 393 on Spotify 3792
Farewell Fiji Islands on SC 2151 on Spotify 7944
Diversity Disappears on SC 3603 on Spotify 8309
Farmers on Fetanyl on SC 2252 on Spotify 7670

Please compare yourself: Tuh Pa Warez (maybe u need the free app to see stats) https://open.spotify.com/artist/6oJjFUCpoinLtJrCIpy7aw?si=tl0dgcMdQlmBWpp0M42rQA 

Our plan: We bring you all to Spotify - for free :-) 
There you can see how much potential your tracks really have. You will automatically get your own account and can see how often you have been heard and how many follow you.

Normally that costs money, so we give you the opportunity to remix our tracks here. We then upload them to Spotify with you as featured artist and you'll get a passive account there, which you can turn into an active one anytime you feel your tracks are well received.

So happy remixing!

Monne Rubingh, or as he is known on the music scene, MoNNe, is a fixture in the Barcelona nightlife scene. His various events gets fans shaking their booty with zeal, no easy feat in a city jaded by Dj after Dj. Among them, MoNNe is a refreshing exception.
In his multiple sessions he can connect to the feelings of his audience and adapt to their rhythmic preferences via non-verbal communication catalysed by his unusual ability to sync his spinning with the state of the crowd. His direct style is full of brilliant improvisation only cultivated minds can develop, and no digs at his online mixes at https://soundcloud.com/djmonne but truth be told they don’t compare to musical dexterity he shows during his live sets.
Born in Rotterdam, Holland in 1972, he has lived in Barcelona for over 15 years and he is playing his music for about 25 years. His eclectic style of mixing afro-, etnic-, deep- , tech-house, break beat, electro and techno, keep the crowds wanting for more. The parties he produces keep getting bigger and bigger combining the presence of DJ´s, musicians, theatre, art, performances and VJs with the sole purpose of making everyone enjoy the show.
Some of his events:  ‘Get Up And Dance’, ‘Phonk’, ‘Unexpected’, ‘Club Med’, the famous ‘Rebel’ parties,  ‘Slow Down’ or  ‘We Love Glitch’.

Steve RIOU is Se-Te-Ve.
Active for more than ten years, this fervent advocate of vinyl took inspiration from artists such as Kerri Chandler, Juan Atkins or even Art of Noise.
Energetic and exciting, his dj sets invite to a journey between Chicago, Detroit and New York.
Se-Te-Ve co-managed Plak records for nearly two years.
He regularly plays with the greatest and is also resident at audio (Cargography), Geneva.
His 90’s house style subtly flirting with deep, dub and raw techno sounds.
A wax affair only.

In the Spring of 1999, he started working as an editor at De:Bug magazine, while also writing for other magazines and newspapers.

As a DJ, he has been a club fixture since the early 2000s, holding residencies at various locations throughout the city and playing regularly at Berghain/Panorama Bar since its inception. He is and has been touring extensively as a DJ, playing hot spots like Concrete in Paris, Robert Johnson in Offenbach, fabric in London or Golden Pudel in Hamburg, as well as festivals like Glastonbury, Nation of Gondwana, Fusion, Garbicz or Melt!. Currently he can be regularly found behind the decks at Heideglühen and STAUB.

He has released various house and techno records both solo and in groups on labels like Spencer Parker's Work Them Records, Ellen Allien's Bpitch Control, John Osborn's Dred Records and his own labels Expansion Unit and Constant Variables. Sven von Thülen has remixed (solo and in groups) A-list DJs/producers like DJ Hell, Ellen Allien or Radio Slave. He continues to work as a DJ, producer and writer.

He co-wrote (alongside Felix Denk) the oral history Der Klang der Familie - Berlin, Techno und die Wende, an in-depth look at the beginnings of Berlin's techno scene in the late eighties and early nineties, which was published in March 2012 by renowned German publisher Suhrkamp. In 2013 a French translation was published, and in October 2014 Sven von Thülen and Felix Denk self-published an English translation called Der Klang der Familie - Berlin, Techno and the Fall of the Wall, followed by a translation into Spanish in November 2015. A Russian translation will be published in late 2019.

The book was turned into a TV documentary called ""Wendeklang""/""In This Place Called Techno"", for which Sven von Thülen co-wrote the script. He also curated the soundtrack, which featured two of his own original compositions. The documentary was aired on French-German TV station ARTE in July 2014. 

In August 2020 he released his debut album Emanating on Dred Records.

New music and a new music related film projects are on the way for late 2020 and 2021.",1978,222,Sven,Sven von Thülen,0,1177,user,2020-12-30T20:51:00Z,von Thülen,32,2,svt,https://soundcloud.com/svt,3,,16,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/1177,soundcloud:users:1177,s:vt,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:1177,artist-stations:1177,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,,,,

In his early youth, Peter's creativity was focused on drawing, painting and sculpting. His passion for music was inspired by the wide variety of sounds played at home by his music loving mother. His interest developed further when he encountered the electronic sounds of the late 80's and amongst his favourite artists and bands were Depeche Mode, New Order, Yello, Ultravox and also Michael Jackson.

At the beginning of the 90's the then 'unusual' style of techno captured his imagination and he realised that here was a sound he'd been searching for. The futuristic themes matched his interests in science fiction and the rhythmic structures of techno, unlike any other music before, made him feel like dancing. He was fascinated by all of the new, previously unheard sounds and was keen to understand how to create them.

Soon, he'd bought his own computer, learned about music programs and eagerly set about making his own music. After years of experimentation and a long search for his own sound, he made his first digital release on Sublogic Corporation, a digital record label. The positive reaction to the release, encouraged him to circulate a few demos and within 2 weeks he'd signed his first contract with Dj Misjah’s X-Trax Records.

In 2001 he released his first record; Sweets EP on X-trax under his guise Forcesupreme. His unique, bombastic and energetic style were highly appreciated by DJs like Marco Carola, Carl Cox and Adam Beyer. The even bigger follow-up ""Funkfragment EP"" ruled the DMC world charts for several weeks. After this Peter wanted to experiment more with sound and melody and started producing tech-house with heavy Detroit influences, which resulted in releases on X-Trax Sub (Mirage EP) and Tsunami Special Blend. 

Currently, Horrevorts has records released through X-trax, Tsunami, EC Records, Phonocult, Global Underground, Echoism and Kanzleramt and has remixed work from artists such as Ferry Corsten, The Timewriter, Secret Cinema, Dj Misjah, Michel De Hey, Dj Remy and Roland Klinkenberg. 2008 saw the release of his full length debut album ""EVOLVER"" on Kanzleramt Records which received massive support from artists from many different scenes. ""EVOLVER"" can be bought as CD, VINYL or Digital format from the Kanzleramt website or other online portals.  

Horrevorts has a number of great releases coming up for 2010, so keep your ears open!
