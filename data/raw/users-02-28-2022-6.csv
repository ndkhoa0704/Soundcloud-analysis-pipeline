  Paul Hardy is a DJ and producer who doesn’t court the limelight.  Based in Leeds in the UK, he displays the typically northern trait of getting his head down and grafting.  This hard work ethic has paid dividends for Paul and as a result he has appeared on some of the world’s most influential record labels and has worked with some of the world’s most respected artists.  But you won’t find him shouting about it from the rooftops – he prefers to let the music do the talking and allow it to bring more opportunities his way.

  Paul Hardy’s original music and remixes can be found on 2020 Vision, .dotbleep, Lost My Dog, Undertones and Deepology amongst other record labels.  He has remixed the likes of Random Factor, Brett Johnson & DJ Heather, Bionic Bump Band and King Cosmic while having his own music reworked by Sei A, Sasse, Jay Shepheard and Miles Maeda.

  As a fan of several styles of music from a young age from indie to drum and bass and hip hop to house, Paul was always likely to end up working with music.  Over the years he has done his stints in record shops (Play Music, Leeds), done the studies (Leeds College Of Music) and has worked at Leeds based record labels 2020 Vision and .dotbleep.  He cites 2020 boss Ralph Lawson as a huge influence and inspiration on his music career.

  Paul is also known for being one half of the Holmes & Watz production duo alongside Jacob Kelly.  They also own and run Baker Street Recordings, a label which since 2006 has released their own music (together and as solo artists) alongside tracks from Justin Harris (Music For Freaks), Lil Mark, Bang Bang and Dubble D.  Baker Street has grown into one of the UK’s leading deep and tech house labels appearing consistently in the sets of DJs like Laurent Garnier, Inland Knights, Dirt Crew and Luke McKeehan and on the pages of the dance music press.

Born in '91 and raised on Long Island, NY, Senith (aka Bosco Clowes) began with an appetite for jazz artists ranging from Dave Koz to Spyro Gyra and most favorably the Rippingtons, all thanks to a family with an expansive background in DJing. As time grew on in, she discovered a new type of music during the mid to late 90's she coined as 'jumpy' music, but better known as 90's dance at the time. Her strict jazz cassette diet then shed its wings when she bought her first electronic music album, Daft Punk's Discovery, and thus the journey was born. The real musical bloodshed started with the year 2003, when she was introduced to trance by many sleepless, late hours on the now extinct 9.27 LIR. 3 years later, she began to take up production from a school music technology course, using a Korg X5D and Homestudio 2 software to mold the framework for some basic tracks. After a few countless tries, she was ready to give up, but that suddenly changed when she created her first ever 7 minute long track titled ""Deadmopnine"", a conglomerate collection of beat interpretation of the many producers out there at the time. Her form of production was still fresh and in its early phases, (and still is) as in her songs could be viewed as ""different pieces and parts of other songs chopped up and put together in non-linear transitional blends"". In 2007 she bought her first set of records ranging from Andain, Conjure One, to Steve Angello, and began mixing on a pair of Numark turntables. Thanks to a certain Sander Kleinenberg compilation, she explored new variations of sounds and artists such as Nathan Fake, Gui Boratto, Robert Babicz, and much more on the darker side of the spectrum. Currently up to date, Senith has been busy at work honing mixes for a hungry audience, refining a much more polished grip on production, and an attitude mixed with a feeling of hope and careful preservation. With each and every passing day, she strives to define her own unique foothold of sound, deriving inspiration from artists such as John Maus, Fad Gadget, and Joe Boyd Vigil. Through achieving this sound, Senith hopes her eminence to become a promising one, not just as ""some other producer out there"", but to be truly celebrated through appreciation and understanding that flows from others....May all good music prevail...

Being influenced by the early 90's of hip-hop and the beginning stages of house music. At 17, Rey held many residencies in McAllen, and also Monterrey, Mexico playing alongside a host of different DJs such as Chris Fortier, Justin Martin, John Acquaviva, Steve Porter, Danny Daze, MC Flipside, Tanner Ross, Steve Aoki and Lazaro Casanova. Rey soon began dabbling around with music production programs aiming on his own tracks. One of his edits he did of Norm Talley - The Journey has gotten big support from Cocoons and Poker Flat's, Argy. More work and original productions began to get notice from more prominent names and soon after signed his first EP of music to Chris Fortier's Fade Records, and then to Lazaro Casanova’s petFood from Miami. Rey's productions has gotten support from the likes of John Digweed, Nick Warren, Hernan Cattaneo, Chris Fortier, Maetrik (Maceo Plex) & Andrew Grant just to name a few. Now at only 25 years of age, this is only the beginning for Rey Aguilar.",975,605,rey,rey aguilar,0,17015,user,2020-06-19T06:48:49Z,aguilar,120,10,reyaguilar,https://soundcloud.com/reyaguilar,4,,11,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/17015,soundcloud:users:17015,reyaguilar,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:17015,artist-stations:17015,free,,,,,False,False,False,

The Shadowboxes are;
Rahza - guitars
Liz - drums, percussions and loud things
Mr. Gemini - bass guitar
Azy - keyboards and broken gadgets
Avex - vocals and pieces of paper

We are a band made up of very eclectic music fans. Liz for example, listens to Melody Gardot and Stacey Kent, and Muse, a lot. Mr Gemini usually jams in his earphones on his bass to Alanis Morissette's records from the 90s. Rahza the guitarist actually really likes to pretend he's Pharrell Williams on drums. Avex just sings anything - currently while we're writing this, he's humming the melody from Jay-Z's 'Holy Grail'. Azy, while not playing keyboards with us, composes for film and is currently writing with conductor Tadaaki Otaka of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Yes, we think he's a freak too.

Melbourne is where we all grew up in and the idea of the band formed in 2008 after Avex moved back from a short 'Sydney' phase and decided that Melbourne brings out better ""emo"" thoughts therefore better music (LOL). We love our single-origin coffees and we love Avex for ocassionally taking us to nice fancy restaurants because he manages one himself at night. Beers from all regions in hidden outdoor pubs all around Melbourne is where our music come from - and technically we can't use our music as legal documents because most the time they're written while we're under the influence.

Everyone in the band plays and write with various other bands but Avex & The Shadowboxes as a unit perform only at secret gigs around Melbourne to invite-only crowds of 20-30 close friends and acquaintances a few times a year. We love our friends, we like to entertain and this is how we like to thank them for their support for our art. The after-gig (drunken) sexual innuendo-laced conversations we have with our fans usually turn into guitar riff and lyrics ideas the next afternoon. We thank you for your beautiful minds.",694,157,Avex,Avex,0,17018,user,2020-08-02T23:54:06Z,,5,0,boxavex,https://soundcloud.com/boxavex,0,,3,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/17018,soundcloud:users:17018,Avex & The Shadowboxes,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:17018,artist-stations:17018,free,,,,,False,False,False,

The London-born producer maintains a consistently high work ethic, locking himself in his studio to compose fresh new ideas on a daily basis and hitting the road most weekends. His positive demeanour and approachable nature also make him one of the nicest guys in the business, traits that will undoubtedly see him continue on his pathway to the highest levels of success. 

Currently based in Los Angeles, Silky’s depth of knowledge and appreciation for the roots of house music stem from his youth, when he became enthralled with electronic music – at the time, in his local area, it was still virtually a ‘fringe’ genre, and he was isolated from many of his peers at school for being into music that wasn’t considered ‘the norm’. Despite this, he stayed ardent in his love for house and techno, following his heart to become a DJ. At one of his gigs he met Frankie Knuckles… the two hit it off immediately and Frankie became a mentor to Silky, passing down the same outlook and ethos that made the Godfather Of House such a respected pillar of the dance music community. 

In the years since that relationship was formed Silky has worked tirelessly to establish himself as a formidable artist and immediately found himself associated with several high-profile labels. With a background in piano playing, his production skills set him apart from many of his peers and he had remixes on labels such as Lower East, Alola and Superfreq. More recently, Silky has also appeared on No.19 Music, My Favorite Robot, Akbal, OFF Recordings and Culprit (with his disCerN project). His sound ethic focuses on the deeper, more emotive side of house music with a driving and uplifting atmosphere and occasion dalliances with the dark side. 

In between his studio sessions, Silky also tours heavily, sharing his passion for house and techno with the rest of the world. Having spent much of his youth mixing with vinyl, his technical know-how and musical knowledge are of an exceptional level and he regularly wows crowds from Hawaii to Hong Kong, still utilising vinyl in all of his sets. In fact, Silky has been booked to play at several of the world’s most influential club spaces and festivals including; Lost Beach Club in Ecuador, Output in New York, Watergate in Berlin, Kee Club in Hong Kong, Spybar in Chicago, The Standard Rooftop in Los Angeles and Mexico’s BPM Festival. He was also recently selected for a much-coveted place on Mixmag’s Los Angeles Lab sessions, performing a scintillating live mix. 

Running in tandem with his musical endeavours, Silky has also put his business nous into starting his own label, Faceless Recordings, which has been off to an impressive start with its early releases championed by the likes of industry heavyweights, Dixon, Ame, Mano Le Tough, Thugfucker, and more. He also picked up universal praise from within the industry and from fans alike, for his collaborative project with Jonny Cruz, which was entitled disCerN. 

Full of drive and determination, Silky continues to pour everything he has into his musical endeavours with several collaborations already in the pipeline. Heavyweights such as Timo Maas, Thugfucker, Nitin, James Teej and Greg Pidcock are among several names he is teaming up with. 

Silky’s passion is unrelenting, his talent undeniable and his productions are consistently picking up positive feedback from a long list of influential tastemakers. With a firm focus on his future, an unrivalled understanding of his history and a foundation provided by the Godfather of House, Silky’s destiny is already assured…

In past efforts, he has played guitar for the funk/rock group The Unknown Jeromes with drummer Jason Tabosa and bassist Scott Clay, as well as played in the world music ensemble Brother Sun, fusion ensemble 650 Connection with former Doobie Brother member Danny Hull, and worked with Carlos Santana bassist Myron Dove and Afro-Bebop group the Pascal Bokar Band for former Dizzy Gillespie guitarist Pascal Bokar. I have had the privilege of sharing the stage with artists such as Chaka Khan, Ziggy Marley, Don Carlos, The Temptations, The Whispers and the O'Jays. You can hear his guitar playing on Ben Vega's latest recording Bury the Times. Most often I can be heard playing jazz guitar in combo settings. Lucien is interested in combining folk/Americana elements with jazz harmony, improvisation and electronic textures. The music for his album When You Go is influenced by the sounds of Country and folk music with vocal harmonies reminiscent of the Beach Boys. So take a listen, and if you like the music you hear look for Lucien's CD When You Go on cdbaby.com and iTunes. 

Lucien is currently working in a jazz fusion trio playing jazz standards as well as his arrangements of popular tunes such as ""Norwegian Wood"" and the Police's ""Murder by Numbers."" In this setting the group focuses on the improvised elements of original jazz charts, giving them a chance to really ""play out,"" and feature the songwriting elements of Lucien's material influenced by Americana and Alt. Country elements. The high level of performance skill in this group allows the musicians the freedom to move between the variety of musical styles we enjoy, while maintaining the highest standard of artistic integrity.

At that time, the sound occupying Beirut was the sound of the uk going from house to techno. It was first in the mood lounge in karlsruhe in 2002 where he first heard a nu jazz set from ""Kristian Beyer & vrank"" now known as âme. After having written down all the records he needed to buy after this evening, he visited the ""plattentasche"" where he will soon spend hours and hours...listening to records and completing small started collections...
After a weekly Tuesday evening set in a small bar in karlsruhe, Guy got the chance to play together with Max Mustermann monthly at the renowned club ""mood"".   
After moving to Bochum, Guy bumped into one of the most interesting bars in the region with a main focus on music in all it's genres and styles ""GOLDKANTE"". With a lot of help from friends and the Goldkante-crew, he started a new evening called ""FUNKLOCH"" an insider House & Disco night that hosted people like Ruben Dominguez, Tanja Harde, Ingo Sänger, Paskal, Dplay, Langenberg and Hans Nieswandt. Due to weird reasons the FUNKLOCH had to leave the GOLDKANTE and find its temporary home at the EVE BAR in Bochum. There he has hosted friends and idols like Agent Schwiech, Boris Hotton, Ingo Sänger, Âme and Gerd Janson.

Curated by the production artist Medicine Fox.
Medicine Fox is Production Artist, Musician and DJ  Shane Wilson. Hailing from the Westcoast of Canada, his music draws inspiration from the ancient shamanic rhythms of Earth's tribal cultures.  As a production artist , Medicine Fox began his career as a listener and a supporter in the studio, collaborating on numerous projects, such as Tulku,  Air Ananda, Sacred Ground,the Little Wolf Band and Deciduous and released his own material on several different record labels, including NewEarth, Quantum Digits and UMR.  As a musician, instruments such as guitar, synths, flutes, and an eclectic variety of percussion shakers and drums find their way into the hands of Medicine Fox.   
From years of deep listening and research, Medicine Fox has collected an extensive palette of unique music from all over the world.  Sharing these sonic discoveries as a DJ is a passion and a joy for Medicine Fox, who can be seen at regular gatherings in Vancouver and wherever he is called to around the world, with performances in the lush forests of the great northwest at festivals like Intention, Blessed Coast and OneLove to the great outback of Australia at BurningSeed.

His passion for music has always been huge and infinite. whatever has a rhythm would catch Mr.Spank's attention ( also the repetitive boobooboom of the washing maschine bouncing around :D ) . Drumming wherever was possible our young musician played in many bands varying in impersonating himself in many kinds of music: from pop to blus, rock and punk. His love for music, though, came out with the discovery of electronic music when he inherited his first drum maschine back in the days. A KORG EM 1 . Then his passion took over himself and, with the interaction of the new wave of making music digitally, MR.SPANK got into genres of electronic music known as Breakbeat, Dubstep and Electro in general. This Guy has a lot to say !

His first experience of the funk came early on when his father, who was making music videos for Motown, brought him to hang on the set of the shoot for Rick James's Super Freak video.
In the early nineties, Walker started playing bass in a funk-rock band called Mobius Trip. The band recorded in Los Angeles with the Dust Brothers of Paul’s Boutique fame and then with Beastie Boys keyboardist Mark Nishita. Walker threw down on a range of projects —Including a Lemmy remix, and Vince Neil's solo record. From there Walker's journeys led him to Santa Fe, New Mexico where he continued to hone his bass playing and recording chops. It was there that Walker had his warehouse party dance floor awakening-- and at that moment he began to transpose his live music experience onto the grids of house and techno.
Not long after the awakening, while living in a teepee outside Santa Fe, Walker got a call from a friend in NYC who was looking for a producer/engineer to come work at a downtown hip hop studio. He thought that sounded pretty good, so with fifty dollars in his pocket, he boarded a plane bound for New York. Walker spent the next two years at the epicenter of underground hip hop, working with a long list of artists such as Company Flow, Saul Williams, Mike Ladd, Rob Sonic, Mos Def, Cannibal Ox and countless others.
During this time, Walker also worked closely with producer and engineer Mike ""Tweakin"" Rogers, who engineered Deee-Lite's first record, as well as countless classic Chicago and New York house releases. He collaborated on a string of releases with Jaymz Nylon for labels such as Nitegrooves and Dirty Loop/3 to 5, and produced a track for Saul Williams' Big Dada release, ""1972."" And when he wasn't in the studio, he was playing bass and live electronics in lofts parties, warehouses, bars and clubs all over the New York and the East Coast.
However, by 2000 Walker began seriously longing for the open skies and high mountains of New Mexico and so moved back to Santa Fe, where he began the serious study of recording and mixing music. In 2003 he designed and opened his own studio to facilitate the production philosophy he had developed through his previous decade of experience and during the next five years he produced and engineered numerous records, including the 2006 Grammy winning album ""Sacred Ground"".
Walker’s studio also became the home base for the small but incredibly fertile dance music scene in Santa Fe. Along with his partner, Sylvie Forêt and a family of like-minded musicos, Walker threw epic open air parties in exotic locations, inviting artists such as Bruno Pronsato, Bodycode aka Portable, Lee Curtiss, and Mikael Stavöstrand.
Walker has been a valued member of the Berlin scene since 2008 - his regular appearances around venues such as Club der Visionäre, Watergate, Wilde Renate, Chalet or Katerholzig soon winning him a reputation as a mastermind of the dancefloor. Nowadays, you can increasingly find Walker slinking around various musical extravaganzas worldwide. Look for his tunes on labels like Private Gold, Vakant, Serialism, Dumb Unit, and Jack Off.",1555,145,Walker,Walker Barnard,0,17176,user,2020-07-13T09:02:05Z,Barnard,75,7,walkerji,https://soundcloud.com/walkerji,5,,2,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/17176,soundcloud:users:17176,Walkerji,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:17176,artist-stations:17176,free,soundcloud:users:17176,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:25756194', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000017176-ZfUfhM-original.jpg'}]",,False,False,False,

Since my beginnings in classical piano at an early age, I've never stopped exploring and absorbing countless styles and influences of current and past musicians and producers. As you can see from my sampling of tracks posted here, I'm a restless soul, stylistically - I get bored easily and can't stand still for too long.  My focus the past few years has been on music for film and television, licensing tracks from my growing eclectic catalog of  minimalist and avant-garde classical landscapes, ambient and glitchy textural pieces,  Brazilian-Cuban soul jazz, afrobeat and even banging club floor fillers.  Clients have included ABC, HBO, CBS, Cartoon Network, Travel Channel, National Geographic, Nike, Quiksilver, Marriott and Warner Bros.  Feel free to contact me regarding licensing of these and other catalogs my publishing company represents.  I also co-produce a number of radio shows with DJ Santo for various FM and Internet Stations around the US  and and we occasionally play live/DJ shows.

IF? Records is Sebastian's most recent project, having taken it over from long time techno cohort Andrez Bergen aka Little Nobody, in 2010. IF? Records was established in Melbourne in 1995, has over 130 releases, and a roster that reads like a who's who of the underground in the last 15 years; James Ruskin, Aux 88, Ade Fenton, Si Begg, Dave Angel, Justin Berkovi, K. Alexi Shelby, Steve Stoll, BCR Boys, Justin Robertson, Thomas Heckmann, Jammin’ Unit and Inigo Kennedy, just to name a few.

Previously, Sebastian was best known for the part he played in pioneering techno in Beijing learning his craft as a resident DJ in the city's most infamous clubs, throwing parties on the Great Wall and touring China and Hong Kong. Also well established in his home town of Sydney, Sebastian has played all the best techno parties in last 10 years including Technikal, Beware the Cat, Subservice, Deep as Funk, Lost Baggage and Disconnected.

Sebastian's passion for techno began whilst at university in the UK where he promoted parties and collected vinyl. He has also written many words about electronic music, from feature articles and DJ profiles to gig and music reviews. He was notably editor at 3D World magazine in Sydney during its heyday at the end of the 90s. Sebastian has also worked for Point Blank Music College in the UK and Machine Musik in Australia teaching DJing and music production respectively. And still does the odd tutorial at Machine Musik when time allows. His production career began in 2007 with his debut release, on vinyl, reaching number 7 in the German Club Charts. No one was more surprised than him.",1919,956,Sebastian,Sebastian Bayne,0,17209,user,2020-06-10T13:14:08Z,Bayne,767,94,sebastianbayne,https://soundcloud.com/sebastianbayne,1,,30,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/17209,soundcloud:users:17209,sebastianbayne_if?records,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:17209,artist-stations:17209,creator-pro-unlimited,soundcloud:users:17209,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:71034511', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000017209-tr4icr-original.jpg'}]",,False,True,False,

The name Spanda draws from the principle by which the universe beats like a cosmic heart and is the divine vibration of pure consciousness and creation.

The man behind this creation, Hugo Peterson, began twiddling (plastic) knobs and performing live electronic music in the late 90’s.  After moving to Melbourne, Victoria in the year 2000 he rapidly became a part of the world renowned Australian outdoor festival scene. Before long his skills as a DJ and Sound Engineer found him integrated into the Melbourne Psy scene where he has continued to play the big festivals, including Rainbow Serpent, Maitreya, Earthcore and other intimate gatherings. 

Over the years, many of his productions have gained momentum, while others have grown more spacious and relaxed such as current chill project 'Magic Feeling'. Spanda has definitely gained momentum, and is an uplifting experience that delivers you into the deep flow of universal vibrations through velvety smooth psychedelic progressive sounds and powerful pulsating basslines. Hugo has spent many years working to create this experience with a timely completion of his debut album ‘Knowing’ out soon...  

Having a keen interest in the relationship of healing and the energetic nature of life, fine-tuned frequency has long been an integral part of Hugo’s quest. He uses cosmic tunings such as cycles of planets, the Earth’s revolution and orbit and universal syncopations, in conjunction with chakra balancing intonations and feeling natured rhythms. Get ready to move with the Spanda grooving, silky smooth sounds of the universe on a stomping big quality sound system near you.",1078,445,Oliver Hugo,Oliver Hugo Peterson,0,17229,user,2017-11-02T03:26:56Z,Peterson,46,6,spanda,https://soundcloud.com/spanda,0,,1,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/17229,soundcloud:users:17229,Spanda,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:17229,artist-stations:17229,free,soundcloud:users:17229,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:37055242', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000017229-5e53Gf-original.jpg'}]",,False,False,False,

Since 1991 he has been intensely active in sonic art, producing concerts, installations and recordings, the albums Mass Observation (1994), Delivery (1997), and The Garden is Full of Metal (1998) hailed by critics as innovative and inspirational works of contemporary electronic music. He scored the hit musical comedy Kirikou & Karaba (2007), designed the sound for the new Philips Wake-Up Light (2009), and campaigns for Stella McCartney (2017), Chanel’s Fall-Winter collection (2012) and Jaguar (2014).

In 2019 he designed the sound for the Cisco telephone systems used in offices around the world, whilst his sound work in Vex House in London was voted as RIBA House of the Year. His work Salles des Departs is permanently installed in a working morgue in Paris.

Committed to working with cutting edge practitioners he has collaborated with Bryan Ferry, Dangermouse, Coil, Laurie Anderson, Carsten Nicolai, The Royal Ballet, Wayne McGregor, Merce Cunningham, Hermes, Hussein Chalayan, Philips Design, Mike Kelley, and Miroslaw Balka.

Driven from curiosity and a passion for explorative music making, Pridon (Petros Voudouris) has been releasing music since 2003 through labels such as Low Impedance Recordings, Fluxion’s Vibrant Music, Neo Ouija.

 The music producer from Greece is now offering his full length album ‘Coiling’; this time with a more organic sound, spiced with hand picked performances and improvisations, less hyper edits and a notable desire to focus and magnify a discovered moment rather than his explorations on morphing changes and evolutions on his previous album ‘Apnea Eina’.

After the release of ‘Apnea Eina’, Petros had a brief visit to Berlin turning into a 2,5 years stay. Experiencing the vibrant local music scene offered him new perspective and inspiration added to the UK music influences that he got during his music studies in in Brighton. Now he resides back in Greece where he finds himself a calmer, more fitting music making space in the abidance of constant influences and potentially distracting noise.",688,484,Petros,Petros Voudouris,0,17256,user,2018-05-09T19:11:12Z,Voudouris,95,14,pridon,https://soundcloud.com/pridon,2,,13,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/17256,soundcloud:users:17256,Pridon,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:17256,artist-stations:17256,free,soundcloud:users:17256,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:25140657', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000017256-yYCSPT-original.jpg'}]",,False,False,False,

I drop many different styles; Oldskool Hardcore, Drum & Bass, Reggae, Dancehall, Hip-Hop, Trip-Hop, Heavy Soul & Funk, Jazz, Rare Groove, Northern Soul, Psych, Dusty Breaks, Disco and a bit of House & UK Garage. 
I got into producing tunes back in 2004, after finally getting some kit together.
I always add an element of Oldskool flavour to my mixes, just so you know that I know where all this originated!

On this page you'll be getting my remixes, blends, original tunes and a few select mixes. If you want to check out some other mixes, they're up on MixCloud right here:

Citrus has been considered one of the early pioneers of bass music culture in Colorado and beyond since 2004, when he started pushing sounds focused on glitched-out rhythmic structures and heavy basslines, starting with drum and bass, IDM, glitch hop, and early dubstep. Over a decade later, Citrus continues to carry on his tradition of pushing the envelope and working to evolve dance music culture as a co-founder of the Whomp Truck artist collective.

Star Eyes is synonymous with raw underground bass music. A founding member of the world-renowned Trouble & Bass crew, currently at the helm of the Chaos Clan, this NYC bat girl causes mayhem with DJ sets and tracks that swiftly connect the dots between regional American bass sounds and the hardcore continuum. Though her style moves across breakbeat, grime, bassline, electro and beyond, her aesthetic is continually inspired by jungle, old-skool hardcore, and the warehouse parties in which she was raised. 

Star Eyes is originally from Los Angeles, where she began DJing at age 15 – her name soon became synonymous with California jungle scene, and she was a longtime resident at the pioneering female-led drum 'n' bass night Eklectic in San Francisco. Eventually she founded America's first UK garage duo Syrup Girls (with DJ Siren) and moved to NYC, where she became a part of the Trouble & Bass crew & record label, who were the first to bring Skream & Benga, Night Slugs, Rusko, Elijah & Skilliam, Flava D and more to NYC; in 2009, she began releasing her first original productions and remixes. Since T&B disbanded in 2015, she has run her own digital label and party series called Chaos Clan. 

Star Eyes is also an alumni of Red Bull Music Academy, a former radio host on RBMA/Red Bull Radio and a noted music journalist. She has played at Outlook Festival, Sonár, Fabric, EDC, Burning Man, Stealth, Nowadays, Elsewhere and beyond. With world-class skills and an irreverent attitude, Star Eyes has definitely earned the title ""Brooklyn’s queen of heavy bass.”

After that, as many teenagers, Alex went through a period of Nirvana, Pearl Jam and other alternative, in addition to Depeche Mode, Prodigy... In 2004, inspired by legendary Global Underground mix compilations, Alex bought his first pair of vinyl decks, a mixer and a whole load of vinyls, that are now stacked in the garage... Soon the Technics' were replaced with Pioneers though... Alex has played in such clubs all over Ukraine as: Soundplanet, Forsage, Privilege, Saxon, Xlib, Chocolate, Gienas Bar (Kiev), Holiday (Rovno), Amagama, Kolizey, Kumbary (Vinnitsa), Jam and Knockout (Cherkassy), Chicago (Donetsk), Dom, Hi-Fi, Meridian (Har'kov), Vega (Zaporozhye), Adrenalin (Pereyaslav), PartyZone (Alchevsk), Colloseum (Lugansk), Malibu (Evpatoria), Summertime (Sevastopol) и many others, as well as on Kazantip 2008, 2009, 2010, Deejay Parade and other open-air festivals in Ukraine, including closing after Tiesto in Har'kov show... From spring of 2008 Alex had started is own radio show ""Soundfields"" on one of Ukrainian dance radios... The show included guest mixes of techno and tech-house deejays from all over the world... In 2008 Alex, with the help and partnership of Antonio DGomes, started his own digital label ""Physical Gravity Recordings"" - so to say UK-UA joint venture... by 2011 the label has become one of the biggest Ukrainian labels, encounting over 200 producers from literally all over the world and soon reaching a half-thousand of techno, tech house, progressive and minimal tracks in the catalogue... Working on his own label, Alex actively cooperates with others, such as Musictracx Recordings (UK), Noise Planet Records (Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina), ItaloBusiness (Italy), Little Green Men (Spain), Bavaria Recordings (Germany), 76 Recordings (UK), 24 Beats Records (Spain), Blackfinger Muzik (Spain), Flesh Recordings (Germany), Minimatracx Recordings (UK), UPA! Music (UK), Gam Recordings (Spain), 11 Hz Records (Brazil), Potobolo Records (France), Seaburn Records (Bulgaria), DFBH Records (Colombia), Bleep Bloop Records (Germany), Click Muzik (Argentina), Cyborgcrew, Baccara, Tight Lipped, Volt9, Cherry Pickers, Silver Screen... Meeting ""Made In Heaven"" dj unity, Alex soon joined the project, which resulted in the launch of their joint project ""Made In Heaven Records"" and ""Made In Heaven"" radio show on Kiss FM, and a whole lot of explosive back2back gigs in Ukrainian clubs and open air fests.... Soon the cooperation with Kiss FM Ukraine led to a launch of another, more commercial sound label ""Kiss My... Records!"", the official digital label of Kiss FM Ukraine... Alex's obsession with music regularly brings his original tracks and remixes, which include remixes for such Ukrainian musicians as ""Sister Siren"" (Ukrainian alternative band, made up of three beautiful and talented girls), Skryabin, Druga Rika, Gorchitza; his remixes encount top positions in rotation, including reaching the ""hot track of the week"" nomination...

As well as producing dance material and running his own label Psh recordings, he is very busy putting tracks together under one of his many pseudonyms known as Psh Project.
Paul creates Music for films, TV and just about any media source you can think of,
With a wide selection of tracks and so many influences you could shake a stick at, its not hard to see where all the inspiration comes from.
His current material ranges from Electronica chill-out to classical crossover which has been used in many videos across the web,
One favourite being background music for computer games.
He was even approached by a German mig 25 jet fighter pilot who wanted to use his music to accompany a video of his flight into the edge of space!

The “small-town” Canadian knew at any early age that his passion for electronic music was more than a hobby, it was an obsession. This obsession grew into a desire for understanding as he became more and more immersed in what it meant to become a DJ, and ultimately a producer.

Growing up in a town outside of Windsor, Ontario with a miniscule population and an even smaller understanding of electronic music, Matt’s discovery of a sound that was “more appealing and expressive” began to take shape as he approached his late teens. By the time he reached 20, he sought out the tools and skills needed to become an electronic artist, instead of watching from the crowd. Consequently, purchasing turntables and learning to “DJ” didn’t quench his thirst for knowledge; he needed to know exactly how the music was made. Thus, Matt’s true development began as he discovered the technology behind EDM (electronic dance music) and started formulating his own collaborations with his music gear and his newfound love for production. While adding original elements that he had created himself to the music he was DJing, Matt found his calling and shortly thereafter began producing his own tracks. Ultimately, his focus on actually “creating” the music instead of simply “playing” it profoundly shaped the onset of the young artists’ career.

Inspired by artists such as Richie Hawtin, John Acquaviva, Dubfire and Oliver Huntemann, Matt began gaining confidence in his production as he incorporated it more often into his live sets. Interested to know how his work was measuring up to his influences, he sought one out at a local show. Living a short distance away in nearby London, Ontario, John Acquaviva had become a natural barometer for Matt’s progress as an electronic artist. Thus, when Matt slipped John a CD of some of his recent work, it undoubtedly became a pivotal turning point in his career. Impressed by what he heard, John soon asked Matt for additional tracks and signed his first work to one of the most credible electronic music labels in the industry, Definitive Records. With the initial release reaching the Top 100 Chart on the industry’s leading digital download website, Beatport.com, and being licensed to RockStar Games’ “Midnight Club Los Angeles” Matt knew this was no longer the “hobby” it started out to be.

Over the next year, Matt constantly kept up-to-date on the latest technology and various ways to differentiate himself and incorporate more of a “live” aspect into his sets. Using his laptop and controllers, Matt is one of the rare artists that is cognizant of the need to push his sound further. Recently he has performed with aforementioned artists John Acquavia and Oliver Huntemann, as well as acclaimed industry staples, Dubfire, Oliver Giacomotto, Paul Ritch, MSTRKRFT, Deadmau5, Delete (Sergio Munoz) and Anthony Attalla. In addition, he was recently chosen single-handedly by Dubfire to open for his SCI+TEC label party at WMC (Winter Music Conference) 2009. His production can be frequently found amidst the Top 100 Charts at Beatport.com and he is a resident performer at the Boom Boom Room (Windsor, Ontario). Clearly, Matt Herdman is one to watch in 2010 and beyond.",328,52,Matt,Matt Herdman,0,17487,user,2011-12-16T01:47:47Z,Herdman,0,0,mattherdman,https://soundcloud.com/mattherdman,0,,0,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/17487,soundcloud:users:17487,MattHerdman,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:17487,artist-stations:17487,free,,,,,False,False,False,

Short story long: 
When I was a kid, my dad told me I would regret it later if I didn't start playing an instrument. He was right. I have only recently taken up piano lessons, which I have attended semi-regularly. Twice now, one year apart, and I'm three years late for my next session. So there. I program my music.

Since I was able to hear, I have listened to and liked whatever my mom listened to: Tom Jones, Elvis, Ella Fitzgerald, Simon &amp; Garfunkel and so on. When I was 10, I started to develop a taste of my own, and hearing Kraftwerk's Die Roboter in the late 70's shoved me in the electronic direction. I also started liking Ultravox, OMD, Simple Minds, Depeche Mode and other similar bands. And I thought the word ""synthesizer"" had a nice ring to it.

In the mid-80's a friend of mine had both a C-64 and an Amiga, and from time to time we used to get together and sequence our favorite DM songs. The ""hobby"" didn't stick back then, as I didn't have constant access to the machines, and my sequences didn't sound anything like the originals, which put me off a bit. Making music, I decided, was for talented people.

Late one night in 1993 it occurred to me that composing was basically just a matter of putting notes in an order which sounded pleasing, and to surround them with even more notes in another pleasing order. So during the night I wrote/produced my first song ever, from start to finish (16 tracks with Gravis Ultrasound), following the by then very familiar Depeche Mode song structure. Next night I pulled another allnighter and sequenced my second song, went to bed, slept the entire following day and got up and immediately produced my third one. Needless to say, I was hooked and absolutely amazed I had it in me. The end result wasn't that great, but still, it was all mine.

I'm frighteningly unproductive: during all these years, I have managed to produce less than one original (instrumental) song a year, on average. Luckily my income isn't dependent on my musical productivity. 

I have published songs only for the MODEified Depeche Mode fan project, and now I'm collaborating with my brother making original music. 

I am generally interested in working with singer-songwriters who are in no hurry whatsoever.",94,31,Kim,Kim Johnsson,0,17515,user,2021-11-13T10:16:20Z,Johnsson,3,1,kim-johnsson,https://soundcloud.com/kim-johnsson,26,,66,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/17515,soundcloud:users:17515,Kim Johnsson,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:17515,artist-stations:17515,creator-pro-unlimited,,,,,False,True,False,
