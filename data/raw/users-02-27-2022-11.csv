Reviews of ""TO THE CITY, FROM THE SEA"":

""Pucker Up Indie Rock here comes a kiss of life"" 4/5 
THE DAILY MIRROR

""A stunning debut album. It presents Beat The Radar as strident indie rockers with an ear for a big chorus and an eye for romantic detail"". 
THE MANCHESTER EVENING NEWS 

""None of their delighful live rawness is sacrificed on their debut album - 'Miracles' drips with rolling melody that wouldn't look out of place in the Stone Roses songbook, while Telephone Conversation' is reminiscent of early Cribs pepped up a few notches - making 'To The City, From The Sea' a punchy, promising debut"".
THE FLY 

""To The City From The Sea is a sturdy ship of songs that should see them sail to much wider success. It is as fine a slice of good old-fashioned indie as you'll hear, and in a scene packed with angular synths and 80s influences, that makes a refreshing change.""
BBC.CO.UK

""The steady but exciting beats and the low ebb of the travelling bass, line up magically with the thrust of the guitar and those understated but perfectly melodious vocals. I’m glad Beat The Radar snook over city’s borders – Manchester now has one of the most exciting prospects in the UK, blasting through the speakers of its music scene.""
MANCHESTERMUSIC.CO.UK

""Other than the too-mannered jangles of the recent C86 revivalists, not many have tackled traditional indie lately.These Mancs do a superb job, imbuing their escapist reveries with passion, yet keeping bluster at bay thanks to Jonny Swift's mix of biting wit and the optimistic desire in his vocals.The music knows when best to go on the attack or focus wholly on the melodies. Trad, but forward-thinking too.""

""Like The Beta Band's early madcap incarnation, Feal Real combine a love of tribal headdresses with free-spirited sonic invention. Manic percussion, sci-fi synths and menacing, exhortatory vocals energise the London troupe's indie-funk onslaught. This show will be sure to deliver big beats, loud shirts and wide smiles.""

But this moment is directly connected to those childhood imaginings. And for anybody who's on the down side of advantage and relying purely on courage, believe it, it's possible. 

We are still not there, we are still cruising in the back seats of a bus that goes from our hood to the heart of a big city, but one thing's slowly but surely becoming certain. As every stop goes by - we are getting closer to our destination. But we should never forget where we came from. 

95 is one of the longest bus lines in Belgrade. It connects the suburbs with their dreams. It connected me with the first rave parties in my life. Last 95, that goes around midnight, was always the meeting point. For lovers, for dreamers, for seekers, for last chances.

Welcome to Last95 Records, playground for its founder, Danijel Cehranov aka Last95. Lots of peak time music is coming your way.

Aneuria’s made a name blending colorful organic house (jackin’, deep, tech-house) with techno patterns, often decorated with sounds of nature and everyday life. His output is dance production, frequently flirting with jazz and ethno elements, thus also working perfectly as a home-listening soundtrack. As an artist he’s closely bound to names such as Ian F, Tomy DeClerque, KayKay and Dejan Milicevic, established artists and co-workers of leading EDM producers and leading pop musicians.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Aneuria is still quite a fresh name on the scene, though he’s made immense progress in the last couple of years. His earlier deejay performances were all about house but he soon realized that his interests grow deeper in experimental, underground, not only electronic sound. One of the first artists who noticed his talent and great passion for music was his countryman and one of Slovenia’s original techno pioneers DJ Veztax. Without prejudice he backed him up and invited him to join the Interparty crew. Years after his musical baby steps, tens of thousands kilometers of traveling, countless days of soul-searching and many nights spent in studios from Belgrade to Barcelona, Aneuria has developed that little something that makes him special as a deejay and a producer and keeps him on radars of label bosses not only in Europe but far beyond. But, let’s pace down a bit and get to know this intriguing artist step by step. In the early 00’s Aneuria and his then performing and producing partner Mexx founded a Muzika-Eclectica, a unique platform that was designed to spread their sound trough the clubland. Their combos reflected minimalistic approach to groovy techno and were crowned with the success of Los Tres Puentes, a great summer record that touched the souls and feet of revelers all over the world. Responses from deejays around the globe were excellent and gave Aneuria motivation for further work. In that time he also touched base with Serbian colleague Dejan Milicevic who taught him a thing or two about music production and still acts as one of the key figure in his career as a mentor and co-founder of Recon Warriors crew together with Marko Nastic. Parting with Mexx as a regular combo few years ago, Aneuria focused on defining his own production and performance style. He builds his sets mostly on repetitive loops, percussions and groove, thus creating tension on the dance floor, driving crowd into frenzy that always ends with some kind of surprise. That allows him to play with audience’s feelings and to build his own story, which is the essence of him as a recording and performing artist. After hooking up with creative soul mates Ian F and Tomy Declerque it didn’t take long ‘till he got in touch with Valentino Kanzyani. In the early 2008 he joined the Jesus Loved You collective as independent artist, frequently collaborating with Ian and Tomy. Their most successful joint ventures were two EPs Tommy Joy and Charije, on which they’ve introduced Balkan Gipsy ethno heritage to the EDM clubs even before this became a worldwide hype. Also at this period Aneuria’s own track Buenoliter was included on Simplicity vol. 1 compilation and he recorded series of remixes for artists such as Umek, Marko Nastić, Angel Anx, Antoine Caesar, Danilo Tomic and Glorio Veztacci. The last couple of years were crucial for Aneuria’s artist output. He’s successfully redefined his sound, based on fusing house roots, world music, sounds of everyday life and nature with techno patterns, taking it towards warmer, organic spheres. He’s spent couple of months in Barcelona, did some long studio sessions with colleagues such as Ian F, Kaykay, Valentino, Tomy DeClerqueand and Belgrade’s finest Dejan Milicevic who is supporting him from the Los Tres Puentes as a label manager of Recon Light and Traffica: he’s signed After Bonito and couple of Aneuria’s remixes and they’ve released their collaborations on labels such as Darkside and Monique Music and are developing various new joint projects. In 2010 Aneuria’s finally settled down in the little town on the outskirts of Slovenian Alps, where he works on his own artist material and acts as a studio engineer and producer for other fresh as well as established artists. He’s involved in two very interesting projects with his colleague KayKay. They are exploring Balkan music heritage and mashing it up with EDM trough the FOA (Fusion of Art) project, while they’re blending downtempo jazz with vanguard electronica under the moniker NMS (No Music Suggestions). Aneuria is also functioning as a local underground music scene developer. He’s put together his own label Gilesku Records, which will serve as a launch pad for Dejan Milicevic’s artist album, released in exclusive edition of 300 vinyl copies, as well as his own material, a collection of experimental deep techno material, which he’s labeling as music trips. With Ian F, he’s co-managing trendy club residency Colours, hosted in Ljubljana’s legendary club K4, on which they present fresh underground artists from all over the Europe as well as domestic talents. In the new season the series will be upgraded by Colours Music label, accompanied with their own alternative, non-business oriented music distribution model, which sole aim is to spread their music philosophy even further trough the global clubland.

Having previously played in local indie/post-punk groups The Total Drop and The Roaring Twenties, the members combined forces to embrace a more pop-centric sensibility, taking their name from the title of a song by New York experimental musician Arthur Russell, whose melancholic, heartfelt approach to electronic music was one on their early influences.

The band's debut singles This Is Not the Fire and I Am the Sound were produced by Andy Spence of New Young Pony Club and released in 2009 as part of the I Am the Sound EP, alongside two B-sides produced by Hot Chip's Joe Goddard.  The tracks featured on several compilations, including Kitsuné Maison Compilation 8 and Modular's 'Leave Them All Behind III' and the band also contributed a cover of Arm Around You to A Tribute to Arthur Russell which came on the Electric Minds label that year.

Following tours in the UK and Europe, and a run of festival appearances, including a slot on the John Peel Stage at Glastonbury Festival in 2011, the band released third single Endless Summer through their own Snakes & Ladders label. The track was playlisted by BBC 6 Music and XFM and paved the way for a new, more live-influenced sound, with the band taking on production duties in the studio.

In November 2011, they released a fourth single, Written in Red with The Gold Rush following in June 2012 ahead of the release of debut album Celeste in July 2012. Final single Let Me Go was released in November 2012 and was named Single of the Week on BBC 6 Music.

The band is on indefinite hiatus as of 2014.  Anna Vincent and James Vincent went on to form dream-rock band Heavy Heart and Gary Drain, Jamie Harrison, and Seb Underhill now perform as Glowing Sun.",506,71,,,0,12639,user,2021-03-02T20:12:19Z,,24,1,mytigermytiming,https://soundcloud.com/mytigermytiming,6,,36,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/12639,soundcloud:users:12639,My Tiger My Timing,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:12639,artist-stations:12639,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:12639,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:5022660', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000012639-lnOv9k-original.jpg'}]",

She is a Detroit native with over 26 years behind the turntables, synthesizers and drum machines . Michelle was drawn to music and the creative side of life from the beginning. She was fortunate to find her way into the early 90’s Detroit techno scene when the energy was awe inspiring, from that moment Punisher emerged. As a record aficionado, her preference behind the decks is playing vinyl and her knowledge of records is vast. Her studio tracks are devoted to hardware, analog gear and spontaneous live mix downs.  A strong understanding of machines and midi programming allows her to perform powerful, dance floor igniting, live PA sets that take you on a journey through hypnotic, cerebral soundscapes. Michelle released her first two records in 1997 on Detroit label Matrix and has since appeared on over 40 different releases on internationally recognized labels including Denied Music, Detroit Underground, Synewave and her own imprint Hej Records. While mainly focused on techno and house, Michelle has the ability to play across multiple genres. Punisher has performed at clubs and festivals all over the globe, alongside world renowned acts such as Sebastian Mullaert, Maceo Plex, The Black Madonna, Richie Hawtin and The Orb. Most recently she was brought on as a resident at the globally recognized “Make it New” event in Cambridge. Michelle will continue to travel where the music takes her in pursuit of musical enlightenment.",1140,1055,Michelle,Michelle Herrmann,0,12673,user,2020-04-09T15:59:38Z,Herrmann,25,5,punisher,https://soundcloud.com/punisher,7,,27,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/12673,soundcloud:users:12673,punisher,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:12673,artist-stations:12673,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,soundcloud:users:12673,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:37785541', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000012673-Mc0gdv-original.jpg'}]",

Their three EPs have all featured on BBC radio and are made up of tales of madness and regret that may seem beautiful, if you don’t get too close.

In the late 80s and early 90s, he had some pretty cool and unusual musical influences. This lead to a healthy knowledge of computers, instruments and sound.

From 1997 to 2001, Schugar produced and performed music under many names including Fatal Erection(experimental click house), Finding NoWhere(Ambient Drones) and Matt Loathing(of Unconditional Loathing).

Unconditional Loathing was a constant experiment in sound and cultural/social manipulation with ever changing instrumentation, member roles, costumes, side projects, members, themes and presentation styles. Noise Opera, megaphones, puppet shows, percussion, homemade instruments, guitar pedals, computers, circuit bent kids toys, instruments of all kinds, Unconditional Loathing was a nightmare of sound that toured from Olympia, Washington to the depths of Ground Zero NYC 7 days after 9/11/2001. Shortly after the Phi-Phenom tour, which entailed 10 bands collectively performing in 50 minutes or less, Unconditional Loathing fell apart with its members dispersing themselves mostly across the West Coast.

Schugar created and destroyed every type of music at least once, dabbling in everything from noise and avante jazz, to ambient and intelligent, to house and techno. Schugar’s style has been a constant evolution of discovery and experimentation. Some call it disco or techno or whatever other socially acceptable term you can think of at the moment (nuretrodubhouseclickdeepdiscotech). Schugar’s sound varies from emotional to upbeat to dark and moody to happy and soulful.

In October 2001, Schugar moved to San Diego. There he produced 100's of art and music events, expanding his vision of artists collaborating and creating together. Schugar started such nights as Velvet Revolution, Filthy Sunday, Basic Tuesdays, Bleep Bloop, Dr. No's Fantasy and many more

Being an avid music collector since the early 80's and DJ since the early 90's, Schugar felt right at home joining the staff at local dance vinyl shop (calsound) in 2004. Calsound gave Schugar a further defined sound as his influences expanded every day becoming the Techno buyer and working along side House & Disco historian and long-time San Diego DJ legend Mark E Quark. 

In early 2009, Schugar created The Infusion Project, an artist collective that develops and empowers artists to be artists for a living. The Infusion Project has been a major source for collaboration and artistic evolution for Schugar. The Infusion Project is the next stage of Schugar’s vision of human beings seeing their creativity as a necessary part of life and seeing collaboration as their access to having that creativity be sustainable and useful to themselves and their community.

Since early 2010, Schugar has dedicated his time to expanding the vision of The Infusion Project through touring as a DJ/Promoter/Creative Director/Artist Coach, playing clubs, festivals and underground events as well as producing art and music events.

Based on Techno and House music as their primary element, they have successfully incorporated elements of Jazz, Hip-hop, Broken Beat, Pop and Rock to create an exciting new art form.

i found this funny review on ""me"" the other day on CHICAGOREADERdotCOM. 

""SKISM - At the top of his SoundCloud page, Berlin-based producer and DJ Stefan Batsch (aka Skism) has written, ""Move on, no dubstep here. I even hate it."" That's a pretty brutal sentiment, especially coming from someone who made his name with big, stuttery beats and wub-wub-wub bass lines. It does happen to more or less sum up the underground dance scene's current opinion of the style as played out, though. Abandoning dubstep looks to have been a good move for him because, to be honest, he was unremarkable at it. But he shines on the mixes he's posted to SoundCloud over the past year, which pile up unlikely combinations of Italo-disco, Krautrock, psychedelia, and some kind of fardled funk shit that sounds like a bunch of hippies locked in a studio with a Moog, a mess of percussion instruments, and about a hundred tabs of acid. — Miles Raymer""

dear miles raymer, thanks for the fairly good impression of what my mixes feel like, but here's the big bummer: i'm not the dubstep-skism you're talking about. that guy just chose the same name and probably would hate to be mistaken with me. at least i do. musically.


by the way: if you see me behind the decks on a party, don't get confused - that guy next to me is neither a deck shark nor a drunk that's getting on my nerves. it's most likely wunderwaffel, who's my dj partner most of the time.
well, the last sentence was kinda untrue. he is drunk and getting on my nerves. but he's a good guy with a great musical taste.

Hailing from the Greek capital, Thodoris Triantafillou has excelled in all corners of the industry after devoting his life and career to a creative output that illustrates a concoction of influences from across the musical sphere. Recognised by peers and fans through a stream of compelling releases on labels such as Glory Hill Studio, Atlant Records, Chapter 24, Bedrock Music among others. 
 it’s the composition of the philosophy behind a record, the raw energy that electronic formats have to offer, and an exploration of the inner self that makes Thodoris’s productions stand out amongst the rest. Over the past Years, Thodoris’ position within the dance music industry has propelled after breaching many top 10 sales charts and Dj charts. One milestone onto another, Thodoris then championed all niche’s that lay in the DJ/Producer pathway with the outlook of always pushing forward as an artist to the next task at hand. Testament to this, are the events Thodoris has been hand picked for, from peak time performances at some of the most notorious European mainstays, to the sun fuelled sets that festivals and balaeric affairs alike provide. As time pushes on and music evolves, as does Thodoris. Keeping the unrelenting yet satisfying pace of the past, he looks to the horizon as awe inspired by the beautiful scene as day one. New monuments will reveal themselves the following year.


Bio EN (Xtended)

In the late '90s he released his first single, an album he wrote and sold without consideration for downloads. Available as .wav and .mp3 formats, it was distributed by metadubsoundesign.com (MDSD). The new millennium came and with it came the rise of digital distribution. The delivery mode of the industry changed and the ease to release and distribute music was beneficial yet chaotic for the young artist.  Under the name of Novox, with Lostra in the early 00's, he released 5 EP’s under the novox moniker. In the past decade, Thodoris continued his solo career under the name and in cooperation with CJ Jeff, released tracks on various labels. The global distribution and sales of this project brought excellent reviews and support from the biggest names in the club scene like James Zabiela, Richie Hawtin, Groove Armada, Tiefswartz, Dennis Ferrer, Jerome Sydenham, Josh Wink and many, many others.

Working with various clubs, events, and festivals, this multi-talented producer has played at the likes of Watergate, Cavo Paradiso, Synch Festival, Dybbuk clb prive, 6Dogs, Salt N' Pepper and many others...and doesn't intend to stop traveling. Thodoris also writes and produces without sticking to one sound, enjoying the culture of clubbing and coming from an eclectic background of spinning Hip Hop, Soul, Funk, R n' B, Breaks, etc. He believes that ""the quality, character, and distribution of the ensemble is what makes the difference and not the kind of music we play"". With this concept in mind he always pushes to create an atmosphere to entertain a crowd wherever they are found.

Son of two parents of the same decade, although he is reconigzed as bastard son, punk and a bit nasty and unfamiliar but is very fond of his friends so he likes to give as much funk, disco, spacedisco, italo, electro, indie electronic, nudisco sounds as posible so you can have the most fun of your time.
His dj sets may vary depending if the left ear or the right itches, but never ask him for Lady Gaga tune since he was her lover for while and he is very sensitive to remember those moments and he starts to play Queen and Scorpion ballads and that´s not a good idea.
He can also be called ""formerly known as .. but never seen kls beats dj ""as this is his alter ego. But in the moment he puts on his shirt with pixeled stars and his funky glasses there is no going back, it's time to boogie.

He is the actual resident of the RED LAB BARCELONA, were you can enjoy his sets on friday and saturday were his version of freestyle is taken to a higher level.
He´s got an Ambar Bar monthly meeting in the well known ABABOL FREESTYLE and HAVE A BALL parties among many other weddings, baptisms, communions and awards winning parties or the Oscar´s gala....
Has a waiting list to book him, his ego is way up the limits and he charges too much, but always ready to make a set for a bottle of coffee liqueur, so you can give it a try

It´s not only Kiki´s most well known track (with the lovely vocals of Chela Simone) and the name of his radio show on Ibiza Sonica and Proton Radio, but it symptomizes perfectly that moment, when you loose yourself on the dance floor and see him smiling, while he plays music you didn´t know you want to hear.

Joakim Ijäs was born in Helsinki, but has now found his home in Berlin. Initial forays into making sounds with violins and pianos soon gave hway to the mechanical beats of hip-hop, mixed together with more popular sounds whilst playing at school discos before he was even a teenager. With such an early start it was no surprise that before he was old enough to enter a club, Kiki was holding down a weekly residency at Helsinki’s Tempo club, which was swiftly followed by another at the Smile club. A move to Berlin in 1994 to study Architecture was the catalyst for Kiki to step in to the realms of a serious DJ. Impressing the legendary Masters At Work at a Marlboro DJ competition led to him securing gigs at Berlin’s three cathedrals of techno -Tresor, Pfefferbank and WMF. Gigs in Berlin and Germany were soon followed by a string of international bookings and the release of an infamous three deck mix for Sonnenhaus which led to DE:BUG worrying about the health of his, fingers.

With his profile as a DJ growing it was two short steps to releasing his first record on Ellen Allien’s BPitch Control label in 2001, who through a happy coincidence he had met when the pair were double booked to play the same DJ slot. Since then Kiki has become an integral part of the BPitch family growing into a truly international artist, sharing his love of energetic and hypnotic music across the globe from Mexico, to Tokyo and making a little bit of history along the way. With an output that has been nothing short of prolific, Kiki has released a number of genre defining records both as himself and later with partners in crime Silversurfer, Sasse, Chaim, Joyce Muniz and many more. Kiki was the first artist asked to put together a mix for the now legendary Boogy Bytes series, and has been asked to provide remixes and productions for labels as diverse as Bugged Out, Playhouse and Crosstown Rebels where he had the honour of being the first artist releasing on the label. His debut album Run With Me, released on Bpitch Control, was an international success, and led to the video for “Shake Off” (a collaboration with Silversurfer and Captain Comatose) being playlisted by MTV. More recently a collaboration with Sasse and his Moodmusic imprint led to the release of the excellent Grand Cru – a modern club classic already.

However, as he has grown and matured, a yearning to explore deeper and more personal forms of expression in music, has led to Kiki working on his follow up to his debut album: Kaiku, that spawned the single ""Good Voodoo"".

After ""Kaiku"" and especially the huge success of the album single ""Good Voodoo"", Kiki has put out ""Cinema Obscura"" & ""Morning Maniacs"" (with a ridiculosuly funny video) on Bpitch, started a radioshow on Proton Radio in 2010 in collaboration with Noice!, that  evolved into his own show Good Voodoo on Ibiza Sonica and Proton in 2013.

Wearing as many hats as possible in order keep his cover, he has undertaken operations as diverse as you could imagine, and has a full arsenal of audio and visual tactics to depend on. When faced with no choice but to lay down a crowd melting set, he calls back to his roots in all disciplines of House, with noticeable training in the arts of Garage Choons and Bass Manipulation. Once becoming a skilled purveyor of all known modes of DJing, he turned his sights to lighting up the night skies to facilitate improved surveillance and having dudes come to him at parties and say ‘this is some trippy fucking shit man, holy shit, how are you making it do that?’.

Overglow Saturdays (rip), The Flatland Beat (rip DI.fm), multiple residencies as well as VJing for and DJing alongside some of the biggest names to come through the province has resulted in a resume full of positive accolades and minor fame. Being a person not keen to ride single successes to a dusty grave has resulted in someone with a premier ambition to continue to do cool shit all the time and get $crilla for doing it cause regular jobs are a suckaz cause.

Don’t bug him if he’s deep in da mix, please feel free to buy him a beer..

His musical life is extended, starting in industrial bands, moving on to putting on illegal raves as part of the seminal London underground counter cultural movement United Systems, through commercial techno and back into the murky underground of experimental/industrial techno.
Always known to be someone working on the fringes, in the shadows, a true underground artist, Voidloss has become a name associated with progression, a high production aesthetic,  emotional extremes, of euphoria and darkness, with iconic releases on both high profile and underground labels.  His own label Singularity Recordings pushes forward and explores the dark and experimental, leading edge of techno, championing other artists working with a similar aesthetic of uniquity, artistry and underground mentality.
His Live PA`s take people on a deep emotional journey, both for the soul and for dancefloor, breaking genre rules, remaining ahead of expectation.  And his releases and label philosophy continue to be a strong force for individuality and dissent amongst a sea of compliance.",3809,70,Steve,Steve Loss,0,13045,user,2022-01-22T02:16:52Z,Loss,16,1,voidloss,https://soundcloud.com/voidloss,0,,19,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/13045,soundcloud:users:13045,Voidloss,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:13045,artist-stations:13045,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:13045,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:2146332', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000013045-xb2kyp-original.jpg'}]",

In 2006, Jay created his own production project, then called 'Twisted Tongue All-Stars', and swiftly signed to Acid Jazz Records (home to Matt Berry, Jamiroquai and The Brand New Heavies). Shortening the brand-name to 'Twisted Tongue' and teaming up with co-producer/guitarist Mark Dalton, he released two albums with the label, until Dalton decided to leave the group midway through the second LP. 

Following a Twisted Tongue remix project for Oslo-based Aural Graffiti Records in 2015 ('The AGR Sessions'), Jay decided to move on from music, instead publishing two books and pursuing a masters degree in film.

In 2021, Dave Jay has decided to mark the 15th anniversary of the group by reviving the original 'Twisted Tongue All-Stars' moniker, returning to the project's original jazz/funk fusion roots and releasing the 3-track 'Live at Great West Quarter' EP in collaboration with UK jazz horn player Graeme Flowers and LA-based session singer Rose.",898,1927,Dave,Dave Jay,0,13054,user,2021-10-18T11:05:01Z,Jay,91,3,dave-jay,https://soundcloud.com/dave-jay,2,,19,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/13054,soundcloud:users:13054,Twisted Tongue All-Stars,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:13054,artist-stations:13054,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:13054,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:145269138', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000013054-yfPzEY-original.jpg'}]",

Known for their rowdy, energetic performances, Astro-Physics have already shared stages with the likes of: Pendulum, Taio Cruz, Chipmunk, Sway, The Correspondents, The Futureheads, Guru Josh Project, Get Cape Wear Cape Fly, Lazy Habits, Kidz in the Hall, and more.

Inigo Surio aka DJ Largo (half T.E.K, founder of Beiak records) is an established DJ and producer, Largo’s sound has always been underground house, developed from west coast through to electro, minimal and deep. Always cutting edge and always passionate! 
He was born in San Sebastian in 1971 and has been playing records since he was 16. At 18 things started to take off when he moved to London and came into contact with the late eighties dance scene there. Largo moved back to San Sebastian in ‘91, taking with him this London influence. He began promoting events and playing in some of northern Spain’s best clubs: Ku, Keops, Pagoa, Matraka and Jazzberri. 
Largo also has Regular gigs in Pagoa (Basque country) And Residency at Komplot (San Sebastian) and Be Bop (San Sebastian)   Despite his success as a DJ and promoter in Spain, London was where the action was and in ‘95 he returned to the UK. From this time he was a regular with the Clueless System, legendary for their underground parties in East Anglia. Towards the end of the nineties Largo teamed up with Lulu (Clueless System) and set up The Wave; a club night and radio show of the same name based in Cambridge featuring guests Dave Angel and Nathan Cole amongst others. 
Also at this time he enjoyed a residency with Subfunk, again in Cambridge, hosted by Vigi and Mr.B (Streetwise Records, TCR). This time, Largo shared the DJ booth with heavyweights such as Matthew Bushwaka and Dave Mothersole. In 2001 Digital Disco was born, a collaboration of Vjs, Djs and dancers which founding members Lulu and Jim Masters invited Largo to join. Here he played alongside Laurent Garnier, Derrick May, Carl Craig, Richie Hawtin and Carl Cox. 
Largo’s underground style and solid foundation in the Cambridge scene has enabled him to not only play across East Anglia and in London at The End, Heaven and the Velvet Room but also in countless cities across Europe from Barcelona to Rome to Zurich and Ibiza. During his time in Cambridge, Largo hosted a radio show on Pirate TV (a project set up by Ninja Tunes and Cold Cut) and played at Glastonbury festival several times (1999, 2004, 2005). 
He was a founding member of the Labour of Love crew whose warehouse parties defined the local scene in 2004 and 2005 and hosted the second room at Boomslang (nominated for Breakbeat club night of the year 2005, 2006, 2007) both as part of the Labour of Love crew and as a separate entity. Collaborating with Jim Masters in 2005-2007, Largo was instrumental in creating the Bottom Heavy night inviting Derrick May, Josh Wink, Kenny Hawkes, Carl Craig, Colin Dale, Trevor Rockliffe and Dave Angel as their guests. 
Largo has played regularly at The Aquarium, The Rhythm Factory, Café 1001, AKA, The Den, Egg and has hosted the baby box at Ministry of Sound a number of times. He continues to work across Europe and he was embarked on a tour of Argentina in November 2007.

BIOS

J@

Jeremie Arrobas is a founding and former member of Men Without Hats. 
He got involved with music when he was 13 years old, after his father gave him a 4 track reel to reel recorder for his birthday. Since then he has never stopped exploring the world of music. Experimenting with the sounds he generated using the feed-back of his recorder’s microphone and creating ambient recordings with them (without the help of any musical instruments) he went on to discover the world of rhythms trough percussions and drums. 
	Jeremie really found his bliss when synthesizers, sequencers and rhythm machines came to exist. He believes that the emergence of that technology not only gave birth to a new musical genre, but that it also transformed him into the musician he is now. 
His work can be heard on more than a dozen records, as a songwriter, singer, keyboard player, drummer, lyricist, and as a record producer. 
Today he divides his time between his family, his business and his home recording studio. 

LP
	After a few years studying architecture at University of Montreal and a major motorcycle crash that gave him a new perspective on life, Luc Papineau followed his instinct and started his musical career by co-founding Canada’s own “The Box” in 1981. What started as a synthesizer and tape machines fiddling frenzy inspired by British prog and German electronic music of the 70’s turned into a passion for sound recording and live mixing. After a few years with “The Box” scoring major hits on Canadian charts, Luc started a freelance career, mixing radio and TV jingles, recording albums and film soundtracks among which the Academy Awards nominee “Les Triplettes de Belleville”.
	During all these years Luc has always seen the studio-computer as the ultimate creation tool, both from a musical and technical point of view. He is still engineering full time from his home-based studio in Montreal while remaining close to his kids…best of both worlds.


MUSIC_INSIDE

Although Luc and Jeremie went down different paths throughout the years the connection remained. They met in the 80’s and worked together on various musical ventures, and again in 2006, when Jeremie approached Luc for the recording of a French album.
They worked for a year and discovered they had too many music affinities and that they had to find a way to explore them further. So they started recording one, then a second and a third song only to confirm it was just the tip of the iceberg. 
Finally it’s in 2007 that MUSIC_INSIDE was created. 
MUSIC_INSIDE combines writing skills with arrangements, programming, performing, producing and recording skills.
MUSIC_INSIDE is a unique alloy combining imagination, spontaneity and practical thinking.
MUSIC_INSIDE is an association designed to liberate the “music inside” while being guided by outside forces.
