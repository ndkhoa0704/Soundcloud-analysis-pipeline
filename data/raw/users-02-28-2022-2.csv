But there are a small handful of artists whom never seem to disappear, these few, are the true soldiers of sound, the ones that no matter how hard things get, and how tough the hills are to climb, they always manage to stay on their path whilst others fall by the wayside.

London born & Bred Carl Nicholson is without doubt one of these people, Carl started his journey way back in 1990 as an Hardcore MC, and after months of watching top end DJ’s at the time such as Micky Finn & Carl Cox, Carl decided to see what all the hype was about and give it a shot himself, and after 6 gruelling months of his very own brand of ‘Wild Horses’ mixing, Carl got a feel for it and the rest as they say is history.

In the summer of 1994, Carl came across a tape, a tape that was to change his life forever, this tape was the Tony de Vit mix on the massively popular ‘Retrospective of House’ compilation by Fantazia, and Carl simply could not believe his ears.  From that day forward Carl lived, ate, and slept all things TdV, he used to follow him around London whenever he was playing, find a good spot near the decks and just stand, watch and listen.

After about 6 months, Carl finally got the courage up to speak to Tony, and bear in mind to Carl, Tony was a musical God of monstrous proportions, so this was no easy task to say the least, but after a few minutes of chatting with him, Carl realised that this man was just like any other guy, he wasn’t a god, he was a normal friendly bloke who had just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and that gave Carl a confidence, something he had lacked in early years, and it dawned on him that with hard work, dedication and a burning passion for the music and the people it attracted, anything was possible.

Since 1995 Carl has been on the forefront of the UK Underground dance scene, he began his journey living in a doorway in the west end of London, learnt his craft from the undisputed king of Hard House, Tony de Vit.  He’s played alongside everyone from Fatboy Slim, Farley Jackmaster Funk, Frankie Knuckles & Chemical Brothers to Judge Jules, John ‘OO’ Fleming, Paul Van Dyk & Lisa Lashes for virtually every major hard edged brand and festival in the UK & Worldwide including Cream, Judgement Sundays, Frantic, Fevah, Glastonbury Festival, Insomniacz, Bulldog Bash, Miss Moneypennys, Soundscape (NZ), B2T, Traxx (SA), Timeless, Hard Dance Ibiza (IBZ), Sundissential, Trance port Festival (ARG), Round Bass (NL) & Tasty to name only a handful, plus he is the only Hard Dance DJ to have received a residency at the world famous Fabric nightclub in London for DTPM.

The Upbeats’ unique and organic take on 170bpm+ bass music has seen them make their home in the highest echelons of dance music worldwide. Known for their organic and natural sounding drums, The Upbeats are a pillar in the DNB community. The duo have collaborated with stalwarts such as Noisia, Shapeshifter Bad Company,Foreign Beggars, Mara TK, and Mefjus to name a few. In September 2014, their collaborative EP with Shapeshifter, ‘Bloodstream’, reached no.1 in the NZ iTunes Charts 2 days after being released.

They have released on major dnb labels including RAM Records, Virus, Blackout and Vision Recordings along with remixing heavy weights such as Ed Rush & Optical, Black Sun Empire, Noisia, andBad Company. Their album ‘Beyond Reality’ released on Vision records in 2013 propelled them to the highest ranks of drum and bass globally. 2014 saw them remix Submotion Orchestra’s single, ‘Trust Lust’, for Counter Records/Ninja Tune which was widely praised inside and outside of the dnb world. In August 2015, they released a new collaborative EP, ‘Dead Limit’ with Noisia, which turned the entire scene on its head. The title track won them best track at the DNB Arena Awards and quickly became a modern classic. It is almost impossible to go to a rave and not hear the track being played multiple times during a night. Over 2016, they released the first two segments of their latest album ‘De-Evolution’. The final segment, Part III, was  released in Q1 of 2017 to much acclaim. In September 2017, the highly anticipated Re-Evolution (the remix package featuring Black Sun Empire, Emperor, Malux, Memtrix, Annix and Aggressor Bunx) was released. Now, in November 2017, The Upbeats have released their first 4 track EP with Critical Music - the PUNKS EP. It has received heavy rotation from all of their peers, and has been played numerous times on BBC Radio 1, and has also seen them do a 2 hour special for Critical Music on Rinse FM. 

2018 saw them release a 4 track EP (The Pack) with fellow New Zealanders ‘Truth’. The EP sat at the top of the Beatport charts for many weeks. It also saw a resulting tour of Australia and New Zealand where 90% of the 18 shows sold out. The Upbeats have also just released another EP on Critical Music, which has found rotation on BBC Radio 1. The Upbeats have now also had repeated Summer residencies on New Zealand’s own George FM. 2018 saw them release the first 2 releases in the series of their highly anticipated ‘No Sleep ’Til’ EP. They travelled to Japan and Iceland with a bunch of the most respected artists in drum and bass (Noisia, Culture Shock, Halogenix, Emperor), and also worked with Goth Trad and the highly respected DJ Kentaro in Tokyo where they were guests of the Red Bull Studio there. The release is out on the 7th September 2018. 2019 has already been a big year with the release of AA side ‘Sweeper / Disorder and a ‘No Sleep Til… New Zealand’ in the pipeline.

Clocking up over a hundred shows a year The Upbeats have played at major festivals worldwide including EDC (Vegas), Pukkelpop (Belgium), Urban Art Forms (Vienna), Supersonic (India), Exit Festival (Serbia), Outlook Festival (Croatia) and are a staple at the famous Noisia Invites shows and tours, Northern Bass (NZ), Boomtown (UK), Glastonbury (UK), Shambhala (Canada), Origin (Australia).",88805,89,The,The Upbeats,0,14438,user,2021-08-26T12:26:34Z,Upbeats,90,6,theupbeats,https://soundcloud.com/theupbeats,47,,225,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14438,soundcloud:users:14438,The Upbeats,True,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14438,artist-stations:14438,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,True,soundcloud:users:14438,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:140829660', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014438-U0W3Ca-original.jpg'}]",

Es diplomado en Ingeniería Técnica Industrial, en la Especialidad de Electricidad, por la Universidad de Castilla - La Mancha (UCLM), Graduado en Ingeniería Eléctrica por la Universidad de León y Máster en PRL por la Universidad Francisco de Vitoria de Madrid. 

Su primer contacto con la música electrónica se remonta a principios de la década de los 90’s, con las formas más comerciales del momento. Fue realmente a finales de esta década, cuando a través de algunos compañeros universitarios, conoce los sonidos electrónicos más underground, especialmente la música Techno. A partir de este punto empieza a interesarse por artistas similares, y de las formas de música electrónica de corte underground de lo más variadas: Aphex Twin, Orbital, Leftfield, Kraftwerk, Underworld, HD Substance, Cristian Varela, Ángel Molina u Óscar Mulero, entre otros. 

A finales de 1999 y principios de 2000 descubre por casualidad Zona 3, en Radio 3 (Radio Nacional de España), programa musical radiofónico dedicado a la música electrónica, que se emitía desde Madrid para todo el territorio nacional, y gran parte del globo vía satélite, presentado y dirigido por la locutora de radio valenciana (tristemente desaparecida en el año 2009) Sonia María Briz. Tras escuchar dicho programa, conoce el auténtico y genuino movimiento de la cultura musical electrónica más underground, liderada por la forma electrónica por excelencia: el Techno. 

En 2003 aprende a pinchar y se compra sus primeros platos, y en 2004 crea junto a un grupo de amigos el colectivo de DJs y programa de radio ""Electronic Sound"". El programa se emitía en la emisora local ""Onda Mancha Manzanares"" (ya desaparecida).

A la hora de mezclar, Mike GZ se decanta por el sonido más duro del Techno, seleccionando producciones de artistas como: Michael Burkat, Lars Klein, Robert Natus, Glenn Wilson, Patrik Skoog, Slobodan, Dylan Drazen, Chris Liebing, André Walter, Space Djz, Óscar Mulero, Exium, Reeko, Christian Wünsch, Pacou, Joton, Ritzi Lee, David Meiser, Structural Form, Dr. Cyanide o Bas Mooy, entre otros. Sus sesiones están cargadas de Techno de corte clásico, apostando por el formato vinilo para sus mezclas. Algunas de sus sesiones se pueden escuchar en su cuenta de SoundCloud (soundcloud.com/mikegz), y en su cuenta de Mixcloud (mixcloud.com/mikegzakathepreacher).

Ha pinchado principalmente por la zona centro de España (Madrid, Castilla - La Mancha y Castilla y León), y ha aparecido en programas de radio y podcasts a nivel tanto nacional como internacional: Minimized Music (Sevilla), Novaclub (Albacete), Vicious Radio (Redsonja Radio Show, Madrid), Podcast Series (dirigido por Álex García y Carlos Maestro, Ciudad Real), Fnoob Techno Radio (UK), In Progress Radio (Holanda), T.E.S. Radio (UK), su propia serie de podcasts, The Preacher Techno Podcasts, o sus últimas colaboraciones con la serie de podcasts de los sellos madrileños Black Stars Corporation (dirigida por Óscar López Beat y Reloadams) y Violation (serie de podcasts del propietario de los sellos Hardtools Records, U.K. Executes y Basic Form Group, José Chacón a.k.a Dr. Cyanide a.k.a Flat Area).

Como productor emplea el pseudónimo “The Preacher”, llevando varios años experimentado con hardware y software musical electrónico diverso, hasta conseguir su propio sonido, caracterizado por un Techno contundente y afilado, muy influenciado por sus productores de referencia mencionados.

Ha editado para los sellos: Superdrive Records (Italia), The Preacher Records (España), Dark Garden Recordings (España), K-84 Records (Chile), Armed Records (Argentina), Hardtools Records (España), BSC Records (España) y Automatized Process Records (España).",1059,1958,Miguel Ángel,Miguel Ángel Gómez Ruiz-Aragón,0,14466,user,2021-01-05T00:54:07Z,Gómez Ruiz-Aragón,167,10,mikegz,https://soundcloud.com/mikegz,24,,140,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14466,soundcloud:users:14466,Mike GZ aka The Preacher,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14466,artist-stations:14466,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,soundcloud:users:14466,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:122076303', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014466-2kMmkF-original.jpg'}]",

Spending more than 30 years in the music business and looking back at an eventful career Hamburg’s legendary guitarist Folke Jensen is currently producing an album with british artist and poet Leonard Davies called 'HUMAN DRIFT',
A fabulous album ('Was macht die Musik') by legendary band SAAL2 co-produced with JENS KRAFT has been released in March 2015 on TAPETE RECORDS (https://soundcloud.com/saal2). The latest outing is the CD 'Ich weiss nicht wer du bist - extended' by the TILMAN ROSSMY QUARTETT (December 2016), produced by Folke Jensen featuring his hot guitar, steel and mandolin eruptions.
FOLKE JENSEN also known as LEDERNACKEN, a project which was quoted massively during the Eighties and even entered the US dance charts, is involved in bands and projects like TILMAN ROSSMY QUARTETT and THE PUNKLES. 
 Folke Jensen is active as an artist,  producer and mastering engineer in Hamburg.


History:
Some people will well remember Ledernacken, FOLKE JENSEN’s project which was quoted massively during the Eighties and even entered the US dance charts. 
In the last few years FOLKE JENSEN produced the quartet of German songwriter Tilman Rossmy and played in his band. The first recording in his own name features his unmistakable trick guitar. Produced by author and musician Detlef Diederichsen from Hamburg (formerly of German cult band Die Zimmermänner, then producing FSK, Saal 2 and Ja König Ja) the session was completed by pianist Stefan Will (Grace Kairos, Maxim Rad) and vocalist Ebba Durstewitz (Ja König Ja).

A little over a decade after first involving himself with electronic music, Paul Boex is able to check the box next to all of those qualifications. Outspoken, driven and armed with an open mind and critical ear, he has developed a forward-thinking, hands-on approach to music; one he’s keen on sharing with all willing to listen.

Having performed in the past at Awakenings, Soenda, Techno Flash, Planet Rose and his own Mental Evolution, alongside personal inspirations like Jeff Mills, Robert Hood and Regis, Paul has earned his stripes through dedication and hard work. Consequently, a Boex DJ-set is very much like a fine dinner; sophisticated and carefully chosen ingredients arranged under an expert chef’s watchful eye. The end result a dish both familiar and surprising in taste, never the same, always fulfilling.

Recently Paul joined forces with friend and fellow artist Dave Miller to form Abstract Division. Within seemingly no time they have caught the attention of many an ear and eye, putting out quality music on various labels and delivering an intriguing and deft stage performance at every gig.

Dynamic Reflection, Paul’s own label, saw the light of day in 2008 and has since then evolved into a proper, vision-based, heavyweight imprint. Releasing both own material and work by among others Oscar Mulero, Ben Sims, Jonas Kopp, Shifted, ROD, Reeko, Forward Strategy Group, Norman Nodge, Peter van Hoesen, Samuli Kemppi and Jeroen Search, it has left an unmistakeable mark on the genre itself. What makes Dynamic Reflection stand out in particular is its owner’s determination to maintain a careful balance between well-known producers and upcoming talent, always allowing for an influx of unconventional, innovative music.

Now, with many promising plans scheduled, both in terms of performances and productions, the future is looking bright for Paul, Abstract Division and Dynamic Reflection alike.",2168,362,Dynamic Reflection,Dynamic Reflection Bax,0,14471,user,2016-11-16T17:58:21Z,Bax,20,1,paul-boex,https://soundcloud.com/paul-boex,2,,20,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14471,soundcloud:users:14471,Paul Boex,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14471,artist-stations:14471,free,False,False,False,,,,

Although one half of the duo moved away in 2014 to pursue his career and the other became immersed in the ups and downs of family life with kids and career, they still meet up frequently over long weekends.

    The Utensil Recordings Story
    
    During early 2002, feeling the heat of the R.A.V.E. Act and seeing what it was doing to the underground electronic music community, we decided to try and help in some small way instead of just complain. I went to a screening of ""Rise, The Story Of Rave Outlaw Disco Donnie"", a small independent documentary chronicling a day in the life of the New Orleans underground and the now infamous promoter, Disco Donnie. At the time Donnie had just emerged from a long and expensive lawsuit with the U.S. Government. We released the soundtrack to ""Rise"" in an effort to bring awareness to the unfairness of this law and inspire the electronic community to keep moving forward. Utensil Recordings was born.
    
    San Francisco based Utensil Recordings has evolved over the last few years releasing artist singles on vinyl and digital downloads. Our musical focus is the underground dance floor. Be it house, techno, min-techno or electro. We strive to bring fresh sounds and innovative production to the world by cultivating new artists.

The fun family vibe of the Dirtybird label can be traced back to a free event started in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. In 2003, Christian Martin sacrificed his credit cards and purchased a sound system so he and his friends could play the music they wanted to hear. This new kind of house music went against the smooth vocal house that was popular at the time and derived its influences mostly from hip-hop, drum n bass, and American funk. The free outdoor BBQ party was very rough around the edges but eventually became legendary amongst the people of San Francisco. This event was also a very influential factor in the decision by Claude VonStroke to start the record label in 2005.

Today, Dirtybird has offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles and has expanded into events and tour production. As it grows, the brand continues to expand beyond music into merchandise, licensing and artist management. In 2015, Dirtybird launched the inaugural Dirtybird Campout festival, which has been dubbed “Summer Camp For Adults”, and Dirtybird has been recognized from their achievements by being awarded ""Underground Label of the Year"" at the International Dance Music Awards, “Label of the Decade” by Mixmag, “Best North American Label” by DJ Mag, and Billboard’s ""Top 5 Independent Dance Labels"".",257279,192,DIRTYBIRD,DIRTYBIRD,0,14510,user,2022-02-18T05:00:54Z,,70,8,dirtybirdrecords,https://soundcloud.com/dirtybirdrecords,180,,934,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14510,soundcloud:users:14510,DIRTYBIRD,True,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14510,artist-stations:14510,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,True,soundcloud:users:14510,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:158636895', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014510-gWTqnB-original.jpg'}]",

It was a breakthrough by name, and by nature. By 2013, Carlo Ruetz had been playing twisted technoid minimal for a decade, but it was his debut longplayer of that year - Breakthrough - that launched him into the spotlight. Within 24 hours of its release the album crashed into the top spot of Beatport's minimal techno chart, and it also caught the discerning ear of Richie Hawtin. Since that unmissable moment, Carlo has only gathered more and more momentum; acclaimed EPs for MINUS, DEEPERFECT and KD MUSIC, alongside memorable performances at international Minus showcases and Richie Hawtin's essential Ibiza night ENTER. Unique in sound and in situation, Carlo Ruetz is the 'overnight sensation' born of ten years in the trenches of the underground.

Rostock-bred Carlo bought his first turntables and mixer in 2001, and his devotion to the minimalist aesthetic was forged in his early sets. He soon became a regular fixture of clubs and open air parties in northern Germany, then broadened his horizons further, to blaze the stage at ENTER. Ibiza at Space, FUSE Brussels, TOFFLER Rotterdam, 10 DAYS OFF - The Last Waltz Ghent, and a 2015 tour through India. Carlo began writing his own compositions in 2010, and marked up releases for Moonplay Records and Slaap Records before the game-changing arrival of Breakthrough through Supdub Digitales. Carlo Ruetz is Known for starting from scratch with every production, mining deep for unexpected sounds and arrangements, and taking compelling bends and turns while in the DJ booth. It's no surprise that Richie Hawtin counts Carlo Ruetz as part of the new Minus generation. Expect to hear more from this overnight veteran who exists at the leading edge of minimalism and techno.",23718,234,,MINUS / MOOD / SENSO / RUKUS,0,14521,user,2022-01-21T14:24:31Z,MINUS / MOOD / SENSO / RUKUS,391,93,carloruetz,https://soundcloud.com/carloruetz,29,,129,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14521,soundcloud:users:14521,Carlo Ruetz,True,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14521,artist-stations:14521,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,True,soundcloud:users:14521,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:54610507', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014521-IUqdBs-original.jpg'}]",

A transverse flutist is an arguably rare sight in electronic dance music, but that's not the only thing setting apart trained instrumentalist and upcoming producer L_cio. Having become known to a wider audience thanks to his collaborations with floor-savvy artists like Portable or Patrice Bäumel, the Sao Paulo native doesn't aspire to be a DJ, but instead delves deeper into live performance in a club context - which led him to become that rarest of all things, a live electronic musician holding residencies in regular clubs without ever so much as touching a record.

---

Even in the broad and pretty undogmatic sonic landscape that is electronic music today, he's a rare sight: Laercio Schwantes aka L_cio, the man with the transverse flute. Having turned quite a number of heads with his instrumental contribution to Portable's massive 2014 crossover hit ""Surrender"" (""Best New Track"" at Pitchfork, among others), it's not been Laercio's first encounter with electronic sounds - a series of hybrid collaborations, projects and releases sitting squarely between acoustic and synthetic modes of production show a trained instrumentalist and live performer that knows his way around the studio, too.

Born in Sao Paulo to a deeply religious family, Laercio has been around music all his life - amidst the challenges of daily life, his adventist parents would whip out all sorts of instruments whenever the situation would allow it, introducing a young and curious mind to a wide range of musical expressions. It should come as no surprise, then, that our hero quickly felt at home with notes and bars, choosing the flute as his first weapon of choice which he eagerly studied from the age of seven. Even later non-musical career choices always reflected an infatuation with the world of sounds, like his stint as a capoeira teacher, combining martial arts, acrobatics and dance.

With such a multi-faceted background in music, the inevitable tinkering with synthesizers and other means of electronic sound generation was rather a question of time than one of ambition, and sure enough we find Laercio roaming the parties of the mid-noughties, absorbing the unique melange of styles and scales that inform club culture to this day. In stark contrast to most other rave inductees at the time, however, he never wanted to become a DJ: his area of expertise is the performance, not the collecting and curating of other people's releases, and it shows in the unusual fact that Laercio has held club residencies as a live electronic musician in venues like Sao Paulo's The Edge without ever so much as touching a record.

It's a charming anecdote that Laercio presented his presented his first demos to a light jockey and not to a club DJ or promoter, but he did so knowingly, always appreciating a different angle and preferring a free-form approach to musical expectations - instead of locking himself up in standardized delivery. Maybe that's why he's held in such a high regard as a contributor by a growing number of dance floor artists such as Portable or Patrice Bäumel, all the while exploring his own sounds in the club trenches as well as in the summoning pits of the studio. It's what led him to appearances all over the world and in all sorts of media, from London's Egg Club to Boiler Room Sao Paulo or Live At Robert Johnson's Lifesaver tour, a fascinating and highly idiosyncratic trajectory that is bound to hold more surprises in the years to come",16823,864,L_cio - Laercio,L_cio - Laercio Schwantes Iorio,0,14525,user,2020-07-21T01:12:02Z,Schwantes Iorio,548,62,lovercio,https://soundcloud.com/lovercio,4,,2,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14525,soundcloud:users:14525,L_cio,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14525,artist-stations:14525,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:14525,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:155388768', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014525-yrY724-original.jpg'}]",

Over a decade ago D74 a.k.a. Dose the Alien crash landed on earth seeking a life of his own. Lucky for us, He found music and continues pushing his genius across the world. With a background in music theory and education he has a taste and ability to play almost any instrument you can hand him. With years of piano training and roots in Rock and Dance music since the early 90's D74 has pushed the envelope of his sounds to find his own unique flavor.

Setting out to create his own unique sound and fueled by the Industrial sound of the time, his first album was released in the spring of 1990 and was full of hard hitting industrial beats, heavily distorted guitars, and ripping synth lines. The Music Press voted the debut album "" Best Industrial Album"" and voted Dose ""Best Industrial Artist"" by their readers.

Dose the Alien returned to the studio and began work on his first solo studio project in over three years in 1993. The result of over six months of studio experimentation was released in November of 1993 under the name ""Random Noise Generator "". The album was released as a comic book with the music as its soundtrack. His music was now being influenced by the sounds he heard while attending underground raves in the North East US and Canada.

In 1994 he began promoting and throwing underground raves. Starting from his loft apartment in Binghamton, New York ""The Bubble"" was known to hundreds of party goers each weekend as they piled in to hear him play his signature blend of Techno and Trance. By 1995 he was totally immersed in his new lifestyle. Fusing the sounds of Ultrabeat and Trance, he quickly made a name for himself not as a DJ but as a live artist sharing the stage as a headliner with the likes of Frankie Bones, Anthony Acid and Charles Feelgood. 

In 1996 his first 12"" ""Erotophobia"" was released on the San Francisco based 'Utopiate Recordings'. The tracked combined all the elements of his years of music training with roots in rock, techno, and his quirky alien like noises that signified the alien trademark. Not only working diligently on producing music.

By 1999, Dose had thrown over 80 Events across the Northeast bringing in thousands of adoring fans and party kids. Now considered a pioneer of the Upstate New York Electronic Scene, he still plugs away every year bringing in International DJs and Talent in effort to continue educating the masses and saving them from today's typical Commercial Culture.

At the Turn of the century in 2000 Dose the Alien and fellow producer and friend Mike Parker enlisted on a 12 city tour throughout the Us and Canada. Uplifting thousands of party fans and spreading the Dose the Alien sound to the masses, his ability to captivate audiences and lure them into his own musical journey made Dose the Alien a signature headlining name, being requested throughout the United States and Canada.

In 2006, with a decade of experience behind him. Dose with help of long term friend and partner Mikey Parkay created 'Visionary Mindz Recordings' and began focusing on producing there own group of upcoming performers and producers, constantly seeking new and fresh talent to motivate and push the musical forum of which he flourishes.

2007 has seen multiple Dose the Alien Tracks and Remixes on labels such as ""Protium Muisc"", ""SinSation Sound"", and his own Label ""Visionary Mindz,"" including top 20 charting Juno track ""So Sexy"" and his Trance remix of Snow Patrol's ""Chasing Cars"" that received critical acclaim at his 2007 World Electronic Music Festival (WEMF) performance.

2008 has been no different than any other year of his career. In January he headlined “Intense 2008” in Quebec City with Slinky Recording Artist Lee Haslam and Tidy Traxx Recording Artist Amber D. His Label Visionary Mindz hosted one of the four main stages last July at this years World Electronic Music Festival, booking DJs and Live Acts from all over the Northeast US and Canada.

Now as summer comes to an end he is settling in to his new home of Miami Florida and is about to launch his Second Record Label called Intermission Ltd. The new label will cater to the Minimal, Glitch Tech & Experimental Techno Genres and the first release is set for October 7, 2008.

From September 2008 thru July 2009, He Co-hosted ""The UniSound Project"" every week on Womb TV with Florida Native Oscar Taerazz. The webcast aired on Tuesday nights from 10pm to 12am Eastern Standard Time. Womb TV was the first 24/7 live multimedia television station and now carries Internet audiences of 1.5 million each month across 120 countries.

His love for music started at the early age of 12 while he was listening to the early 90s Essential Mixes broadcasted by the British radio station Bfbs. Very early it got pretty clear that his passion meant more than just listening to music and so he started to look for possibilities to produce electronic music and to learn how to Dj.

15 years later, you can say that his passion for electronic music as well as his constant will to develop were absolutely worth it. Remixes for global players like Gayle San, releases on labels like Plus8 and Mindshake and collaborations with Paco Osuna are evidence of his continuously drive of passion. The list of remixers including world class artists like Maetrik aka Maceo Plex, Whebba,Renato Cohen or Sis who put their hands on his tracks is also remarkable.

Since 2010 he has constantly played as a live act or with his dynamic Dj sets at some of the best Spanish clubs including Elrow and Club 4 in Barcelona, Florida 135 or Sankey on Ibiza.

Qzerty is Tommaso Qzerty Danisi's solo project. He is also sound engineer and founder of the electronic duo Redrum Alone. Drum machines, samplers, and groveboxes are his job's tools. His action space stretches out from WARP IDM to UK dubstep and includes ambient music. The result is a dim light sound trip made of specifically assembled instrumental routines. Beholders are hypnotized by synthetic mantras that drive them into territories which are comforting only at a first glance; here they are awaited and brought back to reality by percussive transiences and stylophones that believe to be electric guitars.
Qzerty has shared his stage with artists the likes of Gez Varley (Former LFO), The Orb, Atom TM, Bologna Violenta and many others.",143,189,Tommaso,Tommaso Danisi,0,14550,user,2020-07-14T09:07:35Z,Danisi,47,6,qzerty,https://soundcloud.com/qzerty,2,,9,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14550,soundcloud:users:14550,qzerty,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14550,artist-stations:14550,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:14550,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:59481076', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014550-qagBPr-original.jpg'}]",

One of the most refined and sought after Italian house DJ's and producers, this is  the merit of a long and incomparable musical culture that has seen Luca glide through a very important 28 year career making him one of the most admired and accomplished remixers on the planet according to such icons as MARC CERRONE and LAURA PAUSINI. He has worked with some of the strongest labels on the worldwide scene such as DEFECTED and PURPLE MUSIC and continues to have releases on an ever growing list of international top labels. For Laura Pausini he remixed 'If That's Love' and in particular 'Escucia Atento' that in 2006 won a Grammy Award. With Cerrone the collaboration has been moving forward for many years now such as the 'Best Of Mixes Vol. 3' demonstrates where we see Luca siding up to such main players as Danny Tenaglia, David Morales, Jamie Lewis, Armand Van Helden and Joey Negro. Other remixes in his portfolio include those for BARRY WHITE, GIORGIO MORODER, SANDY RIVERA, JOCELYN BROWN, CE CE ROGERS and AZZETTO Feat. ROBIN S.  For Defected he produced, for the 'GOA 09'' compilation, the instrumental version of LUCA CASSANI 'I JUST...' that will be followed up by the complete single release containing vocal versions and remixes,and remixed,apart from the classic Sandy Rivera “I CAN’T STOP”, the  HAVANA FUNK’s “ALL ABOUT YOU”, whilst on Purple Music he has remixed, amongst others, one of the biggest tunes of 2008, Alfred Azzetto 'COLORS' and is currently enjoying big success with the instrumental version of LUCA CASSANI Pres. AMORHOUSE & Mr. B. Luca has also recently selected the 'My Boyfriend Is Out Of Town' Vol.2 and Vol.3 compilation for Purple Music together with Alfred Azzetto.  His productions have been numerous and have included such big international club hits as 'BRING IT  DOWN' by SIMPSON TUNE Feat. JENNY B. which was also remixed by BORIS DLUGOSH. The latest in the line up is the release Luca Cassani Feat. Janet Grey 'THE REVOLUTION' which is also the first release on Luca's own new label CASTING COUCH Records – a track that has already featured on the Bob Sinclar Radio Show for two weeks in a row! Also on Casting Couch records Luca Cassani and True Beat 'SAFE FROM HARM' , Luca Cassani Feat. Max C 'INTO THE LIGHT', Max who has had precedent collaborations with such names as David Guetta and Axwell and “RRROCK IT!” , also remixed by ABEL RAMOS. His DJ career has seen him resident at the best clubs all over Italy, He has played (and continues to play) in iconic venues such as PINETA in Milano Marittima, SALI &TABACCHI in Reggio Emilia,Qi CLUBBING in Rovato, TENAX in Florence,GUENDALINA in S:Cesarea, ECHOES in Misano Adriatico, THE CLUB in MILAN,NIKKI BEACH in Miami, LE PALAIS in Cannes, CLUB HOME in Amsterdam,IMMIGRANT and STADIUM in Jakarta (Indonesia),LAGARS in Braga,NB in Viseu and Coimbra (Portugal), PLATINIUM in Warsaw, VANILLA  CLUB ONE , WKND and DUO CLUB in Switzerland,  PARADISO in Rimini, PASCIA', BYBLOS, PRINCE and PETER PAN in Riccione, NAFOURA in Castellaneta, LA LAMPARA CLUB in Trani, RIOBO in Gallipoli, DIVINAE FOLLIE Bisceglie, CICLOPE in Palinuro... the list goes on... For the Pineta Club in Milano Marittima he has also selected and mixed the compilations Elite' , Pineta Winter 2010,and PINETA by VISIONNAIRE 2011.  Luca Cassani has no doubts: house music is that which brings him the most emotions but outside of the club world he likes to keep himself updated by listening to any musical genre. To the question 'Why did you decide to play house music?' Luca simply answered that a DJ has to play that which he feels and enjoys the most. Also, he adds, every DJ should concentrate on the technical side of his sets, something that he has always tried to do to his best effort.

Adams created the Proper Authorities to branch out and work on his lifelong compositional and performance skills.

He continues to experiment strongly in the modern pop rock genre with sounds and grooves that aren't usually found there. His appreciation for over-the-top arrangements is tempered nicely by his love for good hooks.

An artist synonymous with Drum and Bass, Ed Rush has become a byword for cutting edge, forward thinking
beats. Moving through the sounds of hip hop and electro in his early musical years, Ed Rush soon became
interested in the emerging London jungle scene.
Showing his innate ability to manipulate chopped breakbeats and piles of sub-low bass, it wasn't long before Ed
Rush and Nico dropped the huge 'Bludclot Artattack'. The first classic to Ed Rush’s name, this proved to be a
platform for another collaboration with DJ Trace. Simultaneously developing his own style whilst pushing the
boundaries of a genre, classics such as ‘The Mutant' and 'Guncheck' put Ed Rush’s attitude injected productions
firmly on the map.
One of the pioneers of new sound dubbed Techstep, Ed Rush soon teamed up within another leading light,
Optical; to form what would become one of the most progressive production teams in the scene. In 1998, Ed
Rush & Optical released an album universally recognized as changing the landscape of Drum and Bass forever
with the legendary, ‘Wormhole’ on Virus Recordings. Still regarded as one of the main catalysts for the Neuro and
Techstep sound, ‘Wormhole’ paved the way for household names such as Noisia, Bad Company and many more.
Since then Ed Rush has released a plethora of genre-defining tracks and albums, both solo and with his partner in
crime, Optical. Still busy at work on a new Ed Rush & Optical LP due in late 2013, Ed Rush is not merely content
with helping shape the scene and remaining one of its most consistent producers. Beginning his own venture, he
now looks to the future with the birth of Piranha Pool. An outlet for showcasing new talent and veterans alike,
Piranha Pool represents what will be the future of Drum and Bass.",63879,67,Ed,Ed Rush,0,14583,user,2020-11-20T15:14:55Z,Rush,12,0,edrush,https://soundcloud.com/edrush,6,,31,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14583,soundcloud:users:14583,Ed Rush ☣,True,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14583,artist-stations:14583,free,False,False,True,soundcloud:users:14583,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:50186976', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014583-DiBS46-original.jpg'}]",

Ok, few lucky shots here and there. He did get some courage through his releases on M_Rec Ltd. Grey Series, Prologue Music and BPitch Control. 

We might ask him why is he still here? Some people understand to stop when there is no progress.

Juho is a stubborn individual. As a musician his ""career"" might have been an anti-climax with a lot of effort and not much achievements, but is there something else he could do? The poor bugger is not much of an athlete. You couldn't imagine him as a model either. Let's face the facts: he is good enough to be a dj. Juho's problem is that he wants to be a bit more than that. 

He draws his inspiration from melacholy, depression and anxiety. And almost like in science fiction, the future is something to fear. It might be that this kind of self-pity and pathetic dystopian visions feed him as an artist. What a loser.

Do not feel sorry for him. He has chosen to live this way. It is possible that he even wrote this piece-of-shit text himself.

The name Misjah has been synonymous with quality dance floor productions for over 18 years. An innovator, an inspiration and living legend to many. 

It all began in 1991 with releases under one of his alias's ""Dyewitness"". “Observing the earth”, “What would you like to hear”, “The Future” and “The Masterplan” already put his name on the map of dance floor hits forever. They are still considered all time classics. 

After these releases, Midtown Records asked Misjah to start his own label for them; X-Trax was born on December 1994. He started producing tracks with the help of some friends: DJ Tim and Jeroen (Groovehead) Artists such as Ferry Corsten, Umek, and Piet Bervoets (Rank1) also had releases on X-Trax Classics from this label include: Trippin' Out, The Club, Special Acid Edition, and of course “Access” which made it to the English charts in 1995. 

Due to the huge success of X-Trax he was sought after by such artists like: Josh Wink, Jam and Spoon, Reflect, Format One, Finitribe, Denki Groove, etc to produce remixes for them. 

Misjah has also produced under various artist/project names in different styles of dance music. In 1999 he started another project under the name “AMbassador”. It was under this name that he remixed “Blaze - My Beat”. His remix became a huge club hit and was used in the video clip. It also made it to the English charts. 

In December 1999 he stopped doing the A&R for X-Trax. In 2001 he started a new label called ReRun and ReRun Booking's DJ Agency. The agency is responsible for booking some major players in the techno scene such as Hardcell, Trevor Rockcliffe, etc. 

He has released on numerous labels including: Craft Music, Automat, Wetmusik, Pocket, Zync, Mankind, Jericho, etc. Just to name a few. His tracks are being played by many high profile djs as: Adam Beyer, Sven Vath, Carl Cox , Judge Jules, etc. 

Since his dj career took off in 1994, he has been traveling around the globe continuously to all continents. Playing at famous clubs and festivals including: Dance Valley, Roskilde, Mayday, Nature One, etc 

As a DJ, Misjah has his own funky style. His sets contain bits and pieces of almost all styles of dance music from house to techno and from minimal to electro and everything in between. 

In 2008 he started his monthly podcast ""Misjah In The Mix"" which is rapidly getting huge amount of radio play and downloads. He also recently switched from vinyl and cds to djing with Traktor DJ (vinyl and cd controlled of course).

In the world of dance music being associated with the word cheese is often not a good thing, but with dj sets drawing on influences of the finest disco and funk cheese from years gone by alongside some of today's freshest nu disco and house cuts Fromage Disco really was the most fitting name.
  
Fromage disco started out by Dr Disconyx and Nate B as Melbourne’s first dedicated nu disco club night in 2005 featuring guest DJs from around Melbourne.  From that humble beginning Fromage landed a residency at La Di Da giving them the opportunity to support many of the finest nu-disco acts in the world such as Todd Terje, Unabombers, Idjut Boys, Areoplane, Runaway, Richard Sen, Pete Herbert, Tim Sweeney, Joakim and more.  This then led to further opportunities with Fromage playing regular slots both locally and interstate. 
  
  2008 saw the launch of Fromage Disco as a  production duo first through a wide ranging series of edits that have received heavy blog and dancefloor attention across the world.  From the Supremes to Carly Simon, Hall & Oates, First Love, Kat Mandu and Edwin Starr the edits showed early promise of the production potential in this pair.  With the edits generating a good buzz around disco circles, next up came remixes for Aussie labels Dektek Records for Vitreous with the ""Guise EP"" and then Vinyl Pusher with Toy Robtos ""Computer Games.""  Fromage also completed a remix for blog hit ""Blue Dream Lover"" by Gold Coast band ELKE.   

The duo's first single soon followed with Vicious on UK imprint Needwant Recordings (home to The Revenge, Sean Brosnan, and the Future Disco Compilations) with remix by Runaway (DFA, OTP/New York) and Melbourne DJ/Producer of the year Agent 86.  This was soon followed by their second single on Agent 86's label Lightspeed Recordings featuring a cracking Pete Herbert remix that has received loads of attention across the globe.

Not content to rest on their laurels the pair have a brand new single coming soon on Smashbang Recordings with remixes by Infusion's own Jamie Stevens, and a host of other Aussie Talent.  This is to be followed by remixes in the coming months for Tal M Klien, Danny Dorado, Projekt Inertia, and more.

In 2010 it truly seems like Fromage is ready to mature in every sense of the word.

He emerged into the scene with the seminal Cause4Concern sound, which made an enduring mark that influenced many of today’s great artists, including Noisia, and helped to mould the tech aesthetic that we –know today. The Optiv moniker erupted into existence a few years after the establishment of Cause4Concern, with the founding of his own label Red Light Records in 2002, an imprint that continues to be influential in both launching the careers of promising artists such as Inward, Hanzo & Randie, Impak as well as putting out high quality audio from established artists such as Tobax, Telekinesis, The Upbeats and Black Sun Empire. This is in addition to running the pioneering C4C Recordings imprint, that’s been committed to pushing forward-thinking tech for close to two decades now.
Over the course of Optiv’s prolific and long-running solo career, he’s released on a significant range of labels, including leading taste-makers such as Virus, Playaz, Blackout, Subtitles, Eatbrain, Hospital, Shogun Audio, Invisible and Dispatch to name just a few. His commitment to a pure analogue sound, inspired by his techno and electro roots, in combination with a stripped aesthetic that requires audio purity, has ensured that his sound remains both timeless and ahead of the pack. With years of experience behind him to apply to the dance, as well as his immaculate sense for freshness, Optiv is a tried and tested artist who continues to make a significant impact on the drum & bass sphere.",40821,208,C4C,C4C / Red Light,0,14651,user,2020-11-19T16:30:55Z,/ Red Light,430,29,optiv,https://soundcloud.com/optiv,32,,192,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14651,soundcloud:users:14651,Optiv,True,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14651,artist-stations:14651,free,False,False,True,soundcloud:users:14651,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:68722015', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014651-CQgJa1-original.jpg'}]",

His family’s passion for Blues and Jazz were some of his first childhood impressions, that stimulated his musical interest.
Thomas’ sister initiated his electronic music experience, by giving him tapes recorded from BFBS-radio – ‘Steve Mason In The Mix’. Impressed by this new musical experience, he avidly began to collect and record music based on this sound and laid the foundations for his current broad knowledge of electronic music.

At the age of 15, he visited his first Techno parties and recognized how successful DJ’s were at filling the dancefloor and maintaining a nonstop euphoria. Impressed by this way of playing and mixing music, he decided he’d one day reproduce the music style and add his own special beat. He worked extremely hard during his holidays in order to achieve his goal and subsequently financed the equipment he needed for Electronic DJ’ing.
He devoted most of his freetime towards learning how to beat-mix two 12“ vinyl’s turned by his MKII 1210’s turntables. Once he’d confidently mastered his DJ’ing skills, Thomas began playing his special mixes at private parties and shortly afterwards landed a his first Club booking. The gig was so successful and the audience were so impressed with the sound he was producing, the club owner insisted upon Thomas playing again at the next event.
Motivated by the audience’s enthusiasm for his music, he decided to take his music a step further and bought a personal computer, to expand his musical production and ability to craft his own Techno-Tracks.

Thomas’ first EP, “Blizzard EP“, was released on Wandler Records in spring 2009 and is available on all the major online download-stores like Beatport, Junodownload etc.

Summer 2009 Robotarecords (booking-agency & host for local electronic music events) and Thomas Weitz started their co-operation in performing and producing music.
Apart from tackling numerous other music projects, his latest productions will see him complete his full length album next year.
Thomas is currently busy performing gigs at various parties and clubs (pick-up a sample of his mix, or check-out his next next Gigs on his home pages.

This strength of character and no nonsense approach to life is the fuel to Mason’s powerful production style. Since the late 90’s Mason has been an integral part of the Philadelphia music scene and a pioneer in the expansion and movement of American Drum & Bass. Mason exploded into the international arena in 2003 with his signing of ‘Ruff, Rugged and Raw ft. Armanni Reign’ to Dylan’s Freak Recordings. From there, the offers and tunes just kept coming. With releases on Hardware, Barcode, Intasound, East Side, Penetration and many more, Mason was now a household name in the Drum & Bass community. 

Mason’s music has led him to play most of the major parties and festivals in the world including Starscape, Whistle, Therapy Sessions (UK), the infamous Dachstock in Berne, Switzeland and legendary Herbal in London. He has been labeled the “mixtape king” by his partner Dstar. His focus and attention to detail he displays in his mixes have built up a cult like following. There’s been a countless number of times he has heard from fans that someone stole their mix tape or CD. His original production has been played by the likes of Andy C, Goldie, Dieselboy, Klute, Bailey, Dylan, Evol Intent and countless others. He has also been featured on the cover and inside of many magazines including Rinse, URB, Knowledge, XLR8R, ATM and Mixmag. 

Mason, alongside Dstar, runs two record labels including the D&B staple Gasm Recordings and their new bass music influenced label, P5 Records. Fans of drum & bass and even bass music in general can be assured that Mason has everything it takes to be one of the most exciting acts in dance music today. Years of experience in crafting and honing his dj and production skills and knowing how to read a crowd have led Mason to the forefront of the music scene.",2252,137,Rob,Rob Mason,0,14772,user,2021-03-04T15:31:01Z,Mason,6,0,masongasm,https://soundcloud.com/masongasm,3,,28,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14772,soundcloud:users:14772,MASON™,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14772,artist-stations:14772,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,soundcloud:users:14772,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:3017552', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014772-nqDzOQ-original.jpg'}]",

Volcker's Fed is widely credited with ending the United States' stagflation crisis of the 1970s by limiting the growth of the money supply, abandoning the previous policy of targeting interest rates. Inflation, which peaked at 13.5% in 1981, was successfully lowered to 3.2% by 1983.

Paul Volcker has recently come out of retirement to advise President-Elect Obama on the economic crisis and produce techne music for Zbigniew Brezinski's City of Quartz label.

From his tattooed drum & bass knuckles to his ruthlessly hard-hitting productions, Gareth Greenall embodies the spirit of D&B. Uncompromising, inherently underground and refusing to play games, the South London artist’s diligence, creativity and lack of complacency has inspired mass respect from every possible corner of the scene.

Four albums, countless 12”s and over 15 years deep into his limit-pushing adventures, Gareth continues to surge at the very forefront of the sound he’d first experienced as young Londoner tuning in to Colin Dale’s eminent Abstract Dance Kiss FM sermons. Instant jungle entrenchment: he hurled himself into the fray. Vinyls, Reason, illegal raves… The boy – whose mum brought him up on a strict diet of ABBA and Queen – grabbed any angle and any opportunity to get involved.
From ringing up and booking Ed Rush for a party above a pub in Croydon off the back of mobile number on a test press … To scoring a job as in-house studio engineer at legendary rave distributors Alphamagic where he studied the dark art of dynamics at a masters level: Audio wouldn’t – and still won’t – settle for anything less than full immersion.

His own production stripes stretch back to just after the turn of the century when he found himself at the helm of Resonant Evil. Demonstrating their power with a debut on the genre-defining Renegade Hardware, over the course of two years they scorched the repertoires of Moving Shadow, G2 and Outbreak. As Resonant Evil’s brutal bulletins wound down, Audio was winding up. Carving his own path with his own rules, he was soon snapped up by early neuro pioneers Tech Freak Recordings who gave him the opportunity to stretch himself creatively and broadcast his first long playing message. Audio’s debut album ‘To The Edge Of Reason’ showed the world he could cater for experiences beyond the dancefloor yet convey the same attitude and defiant dynamic he’d become synonymous with as a DJ and on 12”s. It was so well received; within a year he was signed by Ed Rush and Optical and for five years became an intrinsic member of the Virus family.

Audio’s work on Virus is where he really developed momentum. Already an established headliner across Europe, his productions and reputation became a global phenomenon, leading to tours in every territory. This reputation was compounded by albums such as ‘Genesis Device’ and ‘Soul Magnet’ which spawned the mighty ‘Headroom’. One of the most influential and successful tracks of its time, it knocked chart-topping EDM star Avicii off the Beatport top spot, dominating the chart for a total of 13 weeks and setting the foundation for his final Virus album ‘Force Of Nature’. Released in October 2013, it threw the scene completely off-guard… No other producer has conjured two albums of such strong-armed quality within less than a year. Just as his debut album had pricked the ears of Virus, ‘Force Of Nature’ attracted Andy C’s Ram Records.

Kindred spirits, Audio and Ram Records are a natural fit: both D&B lifers, both as emphatic and enthusiastic about the scene as they were at inception, both dedicated to pushing drum & bass to its furthest limits creatively and sonically, Audio’s decorated career has leveled up once more. To Gareth, though, it’s business as usual; still immersed in production science (now using the unique Studio One set up) and still just as buzzed about slapping a dancefloor into submission with deadly double drops as he was when he kicked off, Audio’s unique punch is harder than it’s ever been.",45404,31,Audio ,Audio,0,14810,user,2020-11-22T13:53:55Z,,14,1,audiofreakcult,https://soundcloud.com/audiofreakcult,10,,104,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14810,soundcloud:users:14810,Aud!o DNB,True,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14810,artist-stations:14810,free,False,False,True,soundcloud:users:14810,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:67197385', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014810-4LadN9-original.jpg'}]",

In the early 00’s he joined True Family Unit Recordings, performing at and hosting raves, undergrounds and Club nights throughout Chicagoland.  House music has always been his main focal point.  His sets are a mix of slapping hard knocks, disco edits, acid basslines, and deep introspective vocals.  Some of his favorite mixes can be found on his Soundcloud account.  BillyO has been busy over the past few years.  His mix Perseverance was featured on a new Housepit Chi mix tape series.  He’s been organizing and hosting events for True Family Unit recordings, with a focus of increasing the number of releases on the record label.  He joined the Northern Lights Crew as a trusted advisor and is an active artist on the roster.  BillyO is also working with Edittrax.com as a co-founder, working to launch a new digital audio workstation (DAW) collectible that is destined to disrupt digital music distribution and value as we know it.

When the going got tough for the music industry a lot of record labels either decided to call it a day, or to conform their music to the latest fad that was commercial and easier for the mainstream companies to sell, whilst Evasive always stayed true to its roots and continued to release quality underground music, refusing to jump on the bandwagon or pander to the suits by watering down its forward thinking sound. Signing some of the finest output from established producers as well as nurturing and creating an outlet for fresh up and coming talent has kept the label one step ahead of the competition. Ever evolving and tipping a wink to the changing sounds of electronic dance music along the way, whilst it’s original ethos always remained; true house music, no boundaries, and no egos, not in any way elitist but welcoming for everybody and anybody that would appreciate it!

Teruyuki Kurihara is a music producer and artist from Japan born in 1979. He started his electronic solo project Cherry in 2007 after playing in some bands. The Alex EP was released in 2009 by the Four: Twenty label based in Bristol. He has released more music on a number of labels, from home and abroad (including Blue Tapes and Organic Industries). 

He has spent time between 2012-2014 living and playing live in Australia, Thailand, England, and Germany, experiences that inspired him to begin his art practice. 

His style has been described as ’marvellous and elaborate lines in minimal design’. He has been part of group exhibitions in Berlin, before returning to Japan and making illustrations for Tomoki Tamura’s Holic Trax.  In addition he has exhibited and made live paintings at festivals including Re:birth and Rural. He has recently been expanding his artistic horizons including both music and drawing art.

In 2020, he released Frozen Dust, a full-length album on Mille Plateaux inspired by nature, particularly the cycles of ""destruction and creation""; characterised by industrial and experimental music cast in minimalist fashion.

数々のバンド活動を経て、2007年よりエレクトロミュージックを軸とするソロプロジェクト”Cherry”を始動。2009年、イギリス・ブリストルに拠点を置く優良エレクトロニックミュージックレーベル Four:Twenty からのリリースを皮切りに、国内外問わず楽曲をリリースする。精力的にライブ活動もこなす傍ら、2012年～2014年の2年弱をかけてオーストラリア、タイランド、イングランド、ドイツを巡り、旅の中で得たインスピレーションをもとに絵を描き始める。

綿密な線とミニマルなデザインが特徴のユーモアな作品は、ベルリンでギャラリーを運営するキュレーターの目に留まり、展示の機会を得る。帰国後はヨーロッパを拠点に置くTomoki Tamura 主宰のレコードレーベル HOLIC TRAX - MONOKLO シリーズのイラストを担当。また Re:birth Festival、rural Festival 等で作品の展示やライブペインティングを行うなど音楽活動をもとより、作家活動へも活躍の場を広げている。",736,346,Teruyuki,Teruyuki Kurihara,0,14888,user,2022-01-21T00:08:07Z,Kurihara,58,10,cherry4493,https://soundcloud.com/cherry4493,23,,138,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14888,soundcloud:users:14888,Teruyuki Kurihara,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14888,artist-stations:14888,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,soundcloud:users:14888,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:84497384', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014888-73os2X-original.jpg'}]",

Its development in the 19th century was economically most important to Cornwall, since its growth took place at a time when the industry upon which Cornwall had previously depended for employment and wealth creation, tin mining, was being forced into decline by foreign competition. Changes in the papermaking industry and its expansion in the second half of the 19th century created a new and growing market for china clay.

The processes of extracting, refining, and drying china clay remain in essence the same as they were in the 19th century, although the application of technology has transferred to machines much of the work done by manual labor in the early days, improved the purity of the final product, and made it possible to extract other minerals that formerly went to waste. Even so, waste remains a formidable problem for the group; despite the use of sand and the application of much research, the production of one ton of clay still creates seven tons of waste. The first process is the pit operation, which involves exposing china clay deposits by removing the overburden. Some deposits may be as close to the surface as three feet while others may be hundreds of feet below ground. Hydraulic mining, by firing water jets from a cannon at the clay deposits, frees the deposits and creates a slurry which also contains sand and mica. The slurry is then pumped out and the coarser sand removed before the refining process takes place. This process takes out unwanted minerals such as quartz, mica, and feldspar. Geologically, china clay is formed in granite rocks by the decomposition of feldspar. At this stage chemical bleaching to remove the stains in the clay caused by mineral salts, particularly iron oxide, can add value to the final product, a technological advance not available until after World War II. ECC operates six refining plants in Devon and Cornwall that take clay from a number of pits and mix it in the quantities required for finished products of varying characteristics. The final drying process, which today usually takes place in natural gas-fired driers, was originally done in coal-fired kilns and even, at some pits, wind and sun dried.",288,72,,,0,14908,user,2022-01-30T19:57:37Z,,102,4,eccgroup,https://soundcloud.com/eccgroup,0,,0,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14908,soundcloud:users:14908,ECC Group,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14908,artist-stations:14908,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:14908,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:126498579', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-6qIwxidFXRkW4zPR-KrqOhg-original.jpg'}]",

Finding a love for house music at an early age, Matt Masters started working for Freerange Records in early 2004. Having DJed for several years before that, he decided to spend his first season in Ibiza that summer and gained residencies with two large island promoters as well as securing a residency on the sunset strip and appearing at many venues including the 10,000 people capacity club Privilege. When he returned from the island, Matt was invited to join the Freerange team permanently that year and the label and its artists have played a fundamental part in his musical influences and ambitions.

As a DJ, Matt has played alongside Jimpster, Milton Jackson, Switch, Hipp-E, Palmskin, Mike Monday, Fish Go Deep, Kirk Degiorgio, Shur-I-Kan and more at the London Freerange Records label parties. He has also appeared at various venues and events across the globe including 360 Dubai, The Warm Up South Africa, The Sonar Music Festival Barcelona and the Garden Festival in Croatia with his unique house sound. He has enjoyed a Freerange Records residency at The End, London and also at Horse & Groom, London for his Wayward parties with Norm De Plume. 

In addition to his DJ gigs, Matt hosts the bi -weekly Freerange Records Radioshow with Jimpster. Guests so far have included the likes of DJ Yellow, Stimming, Manoo, D'Play, Salvatore Freda, Manuel Tur, Gorge, Brothers Vibe, Solomun, Jimpster, Roberto Rodriguez, Pezzner, Diesel (X-Press 2), Deetron, Kasper, Nikola Gala, Fred Everything, Tony Lionni, Andreas Saag, Simbad, Nacho Marco, Milton Jackson, Mike Monday, Palmskin Productions, Andrew Crom, Frank Spangler, Trackheadz, Brett Johnson, Shur-I-Kan, Kresy, Hyenah & more. This show is syndicated worldwide on various radio stations including Kiss FM (Australia), Ibiza Sonica 95.2FM (Ibiza), SS Radio (UK), Club FM (Macedonia), Universal Vibes (UK), Proton Radio (USA), Lush Radio (Dubai), Dance Tunes Holland), Sceen FM (Germany), Sweat Lodge (Germany), Dinamo FM (Turkey) & Pulse Radio (Australia). The show is coming up to it’s 150th episode. 

March 2007 saw the release of Brett Johnson's Life in the Emerald City EP which featured Matt's debut remix, a digital exclusive of WeR1 after Matt decided to delve into the world of production. Matt's 2nd remix for Freerange was a re- work of Jimpster's A Love Like This and received airplay on Pete Tong's Essential Selection on Radio 1 when Groove Armada filled in for Pete. Recent artists Matt has remixed since then Dirty Vegas, Pezzner, Onionz, Tony Lionni, Dale Howard, Pablo Fierro, Evren Ulusoy & more.

Matt has worked with MrCenzo under their MidiDropMusic guise on various EP's and remixes. They have enjoyed number 1 and 2 top chart successes on download stores Beatport and Juno whilst working with labels including Glideslope, Guess, Raw Cutz, Shifted Music, Brown Eyed Boyz, Loudeast, 54 Music and Plastic City Records to name a few. He is currently working with Pezzner under their Arithmetics guise on a new EP and have so far had tracks featured on the annual Freerange Records Violet and Grey compilations as well as a remix on Tom Budden’s Alive imprint. 

As for his solo production endeavours, Matt has had success with releases through Urbantorque (4/ 5* in Mixmag Magazine UK), Pack Up And Dance (Number 2 on Beatport deep house chart for several weeks), Metroline (Record Of The Week on Loudeast FM Spain), Dirt Crew, Saw, Beef, Nightbird & more and has been fortunate to have the likes of Milton Jackson and Soul Minority remix his productions. Another alias of Matt’s is Sam Matters (anagram of Mat Masters) where he has enjoyed an EP on Freerange so far as well as remixing Tony Lionni’s Precious. 

In addition to Freerange he works for Delusions Of Grandeur under his Marcelle La Roque guise and they are currently having great success with their down-tempo disco goodies. Matt has been described as “fast becoming a force to be reckoned with” and Jimpster has described some of his productions as “Excellent tracks full of originality and deep, dancefloor friendly loveliness”. Another busy year for Matt it seems…

Grey Filastine is a multimedia artist dedicated to undermining borders. His music collides electronic beat production with dense layers of voice, concréte sounds, and strings. Pitchfork says it “sounds less like `world’ music and more like music from another world.” Another world is exactly what he aims to create, using sound, video, and dance to express a radically different vision of the possible. 
Filastine’s higher education is limited to driving a taxi in the United States, where he also founded the Infernal Noise Brigade marching band to live score the 1999 revolt against the WTO in Seattle. In 2006 DJ/Rupture released Filastine’s premiere album, Burn It!, which relocated him to Barcelona and launched a decade of releases and tours. His latest AV effort, Abandon, is a video series profiling dances of emancipation, filmed in locations from coal mines in Borneo to office cubicles in America.
Filastine is foremost a performing artist, where sound, image, and ideas are embodied. He is constantly on tour, appearing at festivals like Sonar (ES), Sydney Festival (AU), Downtown Cairo Arts (EG), Decibel (US), Foreign Affairs (DE) and Mutek Tokyo (JP). But Filastine’s work sometimes doesn’t fit any stage or category, his off-piste interventions include an official mixtape for The Act of Killing documentary, a Sound Swarm at the Paris Climate Summit, or a concert in the Calais Jungle migrant camp.

A few years of honing his craft later and Gremlinz secured his debut release in 2004 as part of the MDZ04 LP on Metalheadz. A formidable introduction and a statement of intent for this uncompromising maverick artist, made all the more surreal by the fact that Headz was his favorite label and the most influential to the development of his taste and sounds from day one.

Following his first outing, Gremlinz has gone on to drop a constant stream of tracks on a who's who of top labels, and with each release, the accolades have poured in. Tracks on Renegade Hardware, 31 Records, Cylon, Architecture, Rupture, AMAR and Paradox Music highlight his multi-faceted style, allowing him to drop both break beat-heavy B-Boy affairs and more nuanced dubby half step tunes seemingly at will.

His singular approach has been well-received on both sides of the pond, resulting in a global demand for his upfront DJ sets as well as landing him a spot on Loxy & Ink's HORSEMEN collective, aligning him with a superb stable of producers and a never ending supply of fresh music.

2015 saw Gremlinz set up the much heralded UVB-76 imprint with fellow contemporaries Ruffhouse, which has since grown to include 3 equally well received offshoot labels, Droogs (also co-run by Overlook), 4 6 2 5, and The Stone Tapes (Curated by Overlook & Vega Ruffhouse). Each having a devoted, worldwide fan base eager for the next slice of genre pushing innovation. 

In 2018 Gremlinz career came full circle with a renewed focus in the studio alongside longtime friend and now close collaborator Jesta resulting in a return to Metalheadz in the form of a Gremlinz & Jesta EP on METHXX and a scene stealing joint effort with Quartz.

Now fully reintegrated into the Headz stable, and with the full support and nurturing of Goldie himself, Gremlinz & Jesta are locked in the studio meticulously crafting what will be their debut artist album for the storied imprint dropping in the imminent future...",11697,1904,Gabriel,Gabriel Au,0,14936,user,2021-03-31T01:23:56Z,Au,1477,89,gremlinz,https://soundcloud.com/gremlinz,9,,24,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14936,soundcloud:users:14936,gremlinz,True,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14936,artist-stations:14936,free,False,False,True,soundcloud:users:14936,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:131292039', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014936-m1beWd-original.jpg'}]",

Simon Jackson has been part of the UK's dance scene from the days of the late eighties ""Summer of Love"", through to the international global brand that it is today.  As that suggests Simon draws influence from a wide range of musical styles.  His sets are a heady mix of cutting edge house and techno detouring through his own personal take on breaks.  With DJ gigs that have taken him throughout the UK, as well as promoting the Em-It tent at the Wickerman Festival's Bass Camp this is a man with a passion for music and enjoys what he does.

Bookings: UK/ROW: mark@esp-agency.com

This page is dedicated to my sons: Aidan and Solomon, they are the inspiration for everything I do in life now.

He is best known for his work with Ed Rush, fellow head of the Virus Recordings label, and as a pioneer of the techstep and neurofunk sound. His first single for Metalheadz, 'To Shape the Future'/'Raging Calm' (1997) and his collaborative material with Ed Rush, such as the Wormhole, album (1998) were archetypal developments in the style. The duo followed this debut album with The Creeps (2000) and The Original Doctor Shade (2003), as well as countless singles and remixes. More recently, the duo have returned to form with their (2009) LP 'Travel The Galaxy' containing the modern classic 'Chubrub' and are now hard at work on a brand new LP for 2015.

He also notably did all of the engineering and production work for Grooverider's album Mysteries of Funk, and work on Goldie's 'Saturns Return' LP. In addition, he has produced solo for many labels including Virus, Metalheadz, Prototype, 31 Records, Metro and released in collaboration with many artists, including Ed Rush, Trace, Dom and Roland, Fierce, and his brother Matrix. The first Optical release was in 1996.

""Matt Quinn's savage dance floor productions as Optical (for, among many others, Groove's own label Prototype) have earned him a place in drum'n'bass's premier division.”

""Optical's pure, unchallenged talent shines through on his solo tunes, showcasing an artist well ahead of his time. No doubt the modern sounds of the likes of D-Bridge, Instra:mental and the rest of the minimalist dark revival heads, draw heavy influence not only from Optical himself, but from his inspirations in Jazz, such as Herbie Hancock and Miles Davis. His ability to blend Jazz, Funk and futuristic, technical soundscapes is masterful. From his early work on Metalheadz and Prototype Recordings to his collaborative work on Virus Recordings and the classic Mysteries of Funk (Grooverider's landmark LP), Optical can perhaps qualify as one of the most underrated musicians of the modern era. His mind has crafted sounds which were never before heard, moods which were completely original, and his vision of the future, although ultimately dark and disjointed, is beautifully vivid and addictive. Its a world he pulls you into with each and every track and only a handful of artists can begin to dream of being this successful in their work.""

Virus Recordings has become a DnB scene favourite and continues to release the ultimate in DnB vibes, with artists like C4C, Audio, Optiv & BTK, The Upbeats, Noisia, Gridlok, Ram Trilogy, Matrix, Rymetyme, Sonic & Silver, Pendulum, Mefjus,  InsideInfo, Maztek and more...",30922,21,Virus,Virus Recordings,0,14969,user,2020-11-22T13:52:43Z,Recordings,53,2,deejayoptical,https://soundcloud.com/deejayoptical,9,,118,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14969,soundcloud:users:14969,Optical ☣,True,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14969,artist-stations:14969,free,False,False,True,soundcloud:users:14969,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:21060389', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014969-tMDPj0-original.jpg'}]",

  official bio:
  KID606 is dedicated to bringing his uniquely reckless fucked up and beautiful music to our fucked up and beautiful world. Insipired by the best of electronica, punk, jungle, hiphop, bass, dancehall and techno, Kid606 Fuses it all together with a love of pop culture that Andy Warhol would approve of. Apart from running the labels Tigerbeat6, Shockout, and Tigerbass, Kid606 has performed all around the world many times over, and released records on highly regarded labels such as Ipecac, Wichita, Mille Plateaux, Fatcat, Souljazz, and Carpark. His highly original productions helped spearhead and define the edgy and confrontational glitch and mashup styles that are now common in modern music production. His album ""Down with the scene"" (2000) was a landmark release for the burgeoning international electronic music scene, with everything from hardcore ragga jungle and serene ambient to abstract IDM and the dubby soul classic ""Secrets 4 Sale"" with Mike Patton. Things only got more exciting as Kid606 delved deep into the seedy overworld of mainstream music with critically acclaimed unofficial remixes that many people wanted to hear yet no one else was willing to make. All the while releasing his own original and diverse productions as well as official remixes for Amon Tobin, the Rapture, the Locust, Foetus, Depeche Mode, The Bug, Peaches, Dälek, Ellen Allien, Saul Williams, Super Furry Animals, and countless others.

JUWEE

“Purveyor of multi-genre, infectious dance grooves and a feel-good atmosphere.”


That’s how Juwee describes himself as a DJ. Never afraid of going from crazy party vibes to a chillout level, his musical selections are his own therapy.


„There are shortcuts to happiness and music is one of them“


Raised on sounds of the early 70s, hip-hop and reggae, he always tried to keep himself open to every kind of other music. After discovering Funk, Jazz and Soul, which as he sees it, is the major source of inspiration for most genres, the beat-bender started collecting records, making edits and finally ended up doing originals. Today, this translates into sets where he picks apart and infuses together all the pieces of this music that he loves best: bassline, hiphop, funk, chillout, drum & bass, house, trap…
Though he loves playing in nightclubs, festivals, patios and special events, his love for music goes beyond the spectrum of mixing tunes. As a producer and promoter, he has found plenty of ways to express himself musically.

​
As a part of the Funkanomics he has been rocking parties all over the world and lighting up the main stages of Fusion Festival, Shambhala Festival, Natural Games Festival, No Stress Festival, Motion Notion, Zürich Openair and many more…


Plenty of hard work with his project Funkanomics got him release on several labels like Adapted Records, Fort Knox Recordings, Jalapeno Records, Bomb Strikes, Ghetto Funk, Rocstar Records, Manmade and many more.


„For me, it’s all about good mood. Playing those tracks that get you tapping your feet and nodding your head without you realizing it, regardless of genre, tempo, style, or release date. “


„If you can’t fix it with duct tape or music, it ain´t worth fixing“",3561,593,,,0,14994,user,2019-04-07T12:56:34Z,,298,3,juwee,https://soundcloud.com/juwee,0,,9,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14994,soundcloud:users:14994,Juwee,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:14994,artist-stations:14994,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,soundcloud:users:14994,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:17273519', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000014994-QsAoBR-original.jpg'}]",

Inspired by the electronic music scene and culture, Giorgio Azna started digging for music and mixing from an early age. 

After moving to Athens to study Sound Engineering at the renowned SAE school, he had his first dj gigs in the ancient city. He then returned to his hometown of Trikala, where he continued spinning music on a regular basis.

He is one of the founding members of Boot Up, a collective of like-minded djs and party promoters.

A definite expression of their love (or 'liebe' in german) for the dancefloor, as well as the love of detailed and deep club music, label owners Meta.83 and Eurokai couldn't have found a better suited name for their very personal venture. Hinting at the art of omission, of more and not less, and thus at the label's central philosophy, we find countless examples of their ethos while looking through the generous back-catalogue. 


Varied and full of expression, liebe*detail's eclectic look at house and techno is presented on split-artist 12'' releases, where established artists are often backed by more up-and-coming talents; where bona-fide A side floor-rockers are paired with B sides of beautifully meandering, extended deep-masterpieces.


Artists like Matthias Meyer, KiNK, Move D, Serafin, Lawrence, Gabriel Ananda, Efdemin, Ed Davenport, Daniel Stefanik, Ripperton, Nick Höppner, Vincenzo, Sven Weisemann, Jichael Mackson, Spencer Parker, Lovebirds, Adam Port, Argy, Langenberg, Wareika, Lee Jones, Tiger Stripes and many more have all brought their luxurious sounds to the label, or one of its sub-labels, like ""liebe*detail spezial"", focusing on full artist EPs and remixes, ""liebe*detail digital"" - the exclusive digital imprint or re-issue platform ""liebe*detail limited"".


Liebe*detail has succeeded in creating a platform that caters for many of the numerous facets electronic dance music has to offer. It just goes to show, in this crazy world there's still hope… through attention to (and love for) the details!

During the climax of minimal techno, he began his musical journey as sales advisor at the legendary record store Freebase Records in Frankfurt/Main. Not only deeply influenced by infamous local DJs and Robert Johnson residents of the era such as DJ Meat, Dorian Paic, Vera, and Federico Molinari, but also surrounded by regular customers like Ricardo Villalobos, Sven Väth, Raresh and many others, he took his first steps as a DJ. The enthusiasm of his creative environment led him eventually to techno culture and captured his ongoing interest for underground house and techno music. In 2008 he found himself keen enough to break new ground and moved to Berlin to work for the internationally renowned label Get Physical Music on the one hand, but also to advance his recently started career as a DJ. At that time minimal techno slowly morphed into minimal house, and from 2011 until 2015 he was also in charge as label manager for Oslo Records, the well-known house label founded by Federico Molinari and Nekes. For more than 15 years now Midnight Martin has been spinning vinyls and played in clubs like the Robert Johnson, Watergate, Club der Visionaere or famous Bar25, and after a few years of musical abstinence, he is now back to pick up his old trail again. In spite of musical trends, he has always remained true to his own sound over the years. Old classics play an important role in his sets as well as contemporary productions. Important influences include jazz, disco and soul as well as early house productions of the late 80s, and the 90s from Chicago, Detroit and New York.",35,34,,,0,15064,user,2020-04-29T13:49:30Z,,2,0,midnight_martin,https://soundcloud.com/midnight_martin,0,,0,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/15064,soundcloud:users:15064,MIDNIGHT MARTIN,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:15064,artist-stations:15064,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:15064,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:49811386', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000015064-scZxo9-original.jpg'}]",

The embodiment of lo fi studio madness in a smoky backroom. A strange musical brew that utilises an array of stylistic influences. Some fool has been giving tea, cigarettes and feedback to these fearsome creatures.
