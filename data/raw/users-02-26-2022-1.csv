With the first releases from Trickski in 2005, it quickly became evident that this is not true for these guys. They fit into many drawers! Fans returning home with a new Trickski record habitually tear their hear in front of their shelves: Where is this one going? Techno? Yes. House? Definitely. Disco? Edits? Sure. Deep Slow Motion? Well, yeah! HipHop? Certainly. And Melodies? And Banging? And Deep? Okay, works for them. And still there is a clear trade mark sound that is just what makes Trickski so singular. 
Their openness to many sides has won them friends and critical acclaim very quickly, and so it went that the co-productions of Yannick Labb√© and Daniel Becker as Trickski came to fill the record cases of international DJs across all genres. On top of that Carl Craig featured their first single ‚ÄûSweat‚Äú on his legendary Fabric 25 compilation, which gave Trickski‚Äòs kick off an extra booth. 
From 2006 to 2008, the next step followed: Yannick and Daniel were in charge of  the limited series ‚ÄúMember of the Trick‚Äù. With the help of Berlin‚Äôs infamous Sonar Kollektiv, they published ten vinyl EP‚Äôs and one CD-compilation. The ‚Äúkindred spirits‚Äù involved in this project were artists from the likes of Skwerl, early Solomun (head honcho of DIYnamic), Future Beat Investigators, Schmutzig de Mutzig or the duo Leroy & Darnell.
After extensive touring in 07 - 09 it got a little quiet around Trickski even though they released great 12‚Äús on Future Classic and Chicago based Stilove4music. They attitude is rather to release less and and do this with all their love than putting one 12‚Äú after the other on the market. During that time Trickski have also  been the resident DJs at their favorite Berlin club, ‚ÄúCookies‚Äù, every third Tuesday of the month for the last two years, inspiring young women and music nerds alike to tear it up on the dance floor - sometimes with a special guests like Trevor Jackson, Eddie Fowkles, Solomun. Quarion, Glass Candy (live) or Rainer Tr√ºby, and sometimes without one.
2010 Trickski found a new homebase: on one side it is Suol, run by their good friends and soulmates, Johnjon & Chopstick from Berlin and on the other hand it is the amazing SloHouse inprint Delusions of Grandeur from the UK. Both 12‚Äús (The Warm up / DOG and After & Before / Suol) got amazing feedback. Their tune Pill Collins was even in the world wide top ten at Soundcloud in August 2010. 
In the first half of 2011 Trickski will finally release their long awaited debut album on Suol. On top of that there will be more slomo pump on DOG! Exciting!
Trickski released on labels like: Sonar Kollektiv, Compost Records, Compost Black Label, DIYnamic Music, Delusions of Grandeur, Defected, Suol, Stilove4music, Future Classic, Gigolo Recordings, Mood Music, Raw Fusion or Mina Recordings and djs at clubs like Cookies, Weekend, Watergate (Berlin), Fabric, The End (London), Goa (Madrid), Club 11 (Amsterdam), Dornroosje (Nijmegen) Zukunft (Zurich), Dada (Tel Aviv), APT (New York City), Electric Pickle (Miami) Civic Underground (Sydney), FFour (Melbourne), Gilles Peterson‚Äòs Worldwide Festival (Singapore), Vega, Culture Box, (Copenhagen), F12, Kruthuset (Stockholm), Nouveau Casino, Bat√¥far (Paris), Sottomarino Giallo (Milan), and many more.",330788,246,Daniel Becker &,Daniel Becker & Yannick Labb√©,0,25,user,2020-11-19T16:15:39Z,Yannick Labb√©,57,5,trickski,https://soundcloud.com/trickski,19,,134,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/25,soundcloud:users:25,Trickski,True,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:25,artist-stations:25,creator-pro-unlimited,,,,,False,True,True,

While his many-sided body of work reaches back more than a decade, the Swedish producer‚Äôs current investigations in the field of experimental dance music are as prolific as they are unpredictable.

After a series of albums as Roll The Dice alongside Malcolm Pardon, he lent his production skills to Fever Ray‚Äôs acclaimed debut album and 2017‚Äôs Plunge and is currently busy exploring a new strain of techno-pop together with P√§r Grindvik as Aasthma.

Working under his own name Mannerfelt‚Äôs sonic imprint can be most acutely felt. Accompanying  appearances on Voam, Hinge Finger, Numbers and more, he established his own label Peder Mannerfelt Produktions to carry the bulk of his output, and that of kindred spirits such as Klara Lewis, Code Walk and Sissel Wincent.

Carl √Öborg who goes by the artist name Carl Borg is a Swedish producer, sound designer and film music composer.
Carl started making electronic music at the age of 14. He found his way into house music after buying a Yamaha A3000 sampler, sampling through his friends and parents vinyl collections. In 2004 he began to tour through Europe, South Africa and Russia together with Forss (Eric Wahlforss) as Forss Versus Borg. Playing live-sets consisting of both up-tempo house tracks and experimental glitchy electronica. Carls debut release, the classic 12 inch Splinter Body Scene EP, was released on German label Sonar Kollektiv during that same time. Since then he has released several EPs, remixes and produced a number of original soundtracks throughout the years. 
One of the soundtracks, Tasteology Soundtrack made for House of Radon in Stockholm, has today over 15 million streams on Spotify. With several tracks on the platforms largely popular playlists like Peace and Sleep.
Carl played an important part of the band project SFB, The Stoner + Forss + Carl Borg, a fusion of acoustic jazz and live electronica, in 2006. The project resulted in a number of live gigs around Sweden, and later the album The Lektor Tapes on Gothenburg based label Hoob Records.

Rubber Inc.

Formed late in 1998 by partners Malek Lopez and Noel de Brackinghe, Rubber Inc. successfully pioneered the concept of live dance music in the Philippines. Often confused with DJs the duo originally utilized an arsenal of keyboards, mixers,effects, samplers and sequencers to create music rather than relying upon records or CDs. Having gigged extensively throughout Manila as well as trips out of town to Cebu, Boracay and even Lucena the group have honed their skills to the often fussy markets of the Philippines with a very distinct sound that incorporates elements of techno, house, breakbeat, latin, drum n' bass and the more leftfield sounds of groups like Autechre and Aphex Twin. Not limiting themselves to the dancefloor Rubber Inc. have done numerous art gigs including performances at the CCP (Cultural Centre of the Philippines) sound design and soundtrack work for multimedia theatre and Ballet Philippines at the CCP. Additional production work has included several commercial projects like product launches and commercials, remixes and arranging for local singers. 2001 saw Rubber Inc. break away from the club scene to focus more on studio work; having setup Sweetspot Studios mid-year to cater to recording projects from local labels and unsigned bands as well as their own projects. Sweetspot has become a succesful production company over the years. With Malek focusing on scoring projects for television, film and art exhibits. Noel spent his time honing his skills as an audio engineer and has produced or engineered many highly acclaimed albums. Malek also formed a band 'Drip'; a female vocalist fronted band playing trip hop, drum and bass and everything in between. (dripmanila.multiply.com) Now with Sweetspot becoming a more stable entity and the addition of apprentices, Rubber Inc have found the time and motivation to start producing and gigging more extensively once again. With the years of studio experience and the advancements in music technology the band have a whole new set of tools and skills that has advanced the bands sound and production. 2007 sees them return to the music world full force gigging in Manila once again and being invited to play at the Co-Pop Festival in Cologne, Germany, with further collaboration with the Teichmann Brothers scheduled for later in the year.",369,26,Noel de Brackinghe,Noel de Brackinghe & Malek Lopez,0,78,user,2016-02-19T09:03:08Z,& Malek Lopez,2,0,rubberinc,https://soundcloud.com/rubberinc,0,,16,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/78,soundcloud:users:78,rubberinc,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:78,artist-stations:78,free,,,,,False,False,False,

I started DJ'ing in 1990 in Munich with Garage House, NY Style, changed later to Chicago House and ended up with Detroit Techno (1994) but decided to play ‚ÄúFreestyle‚Äù very early (1996) as I got bored of playing the same kind of music all night long. In the 90ies I played a lot of gigs all over Europe along all the big names at this time. Even Tony Humphries, Jeff Mills, Colin Faver, DJ Hell. In Clubs like Tresor Berlin, E-Werk Berlin, Museum of Modern Art in Copenhagen, Flex inVienna, Raves in Italy, small and big Festivals and many many more. 
1997 I moved to Hamburg where I started a monthyl club night called Club Neu at Club Tempelhof. There we played a really cool freestyle programm, from Hip-Hop to Djungle, from Electro via Disco to House or Beatz. And the crowd there was really cool. They danced to everything we ""served"". 
I also organized there a really cool night with Cheap Records from Vienna meets Clear Records (Matthew Herbert) or the huge DJ Hell at Rote Flora event. Somtimes I had a chance to play the famour Pudel Club which was also big fun!

In 1999 I moved to Berlin where I started ""Support Your Local Ghetto"" which was  the name of my weekly Radio Show on Twen.FM a pirate radio here in Berlin. I had a lot of fun playing my fave tunes plus having guests from all over the world. Mostly my guests where just from the neighborhood.  I love my hood. There are so many talented artists which have to be heard. So, lets stay local. But local not only in the meaning of territory, local means also all the friends and people you have in your neighborhood. Will never forget the outstanding show with Blake Baxter and Abe Duque or with the Stones Throw Dudes.  Some recordings of this shows must still be in the interwebs. Will try to find and publish them here. 

In 2011 I reactived the ""support your local ghetto"" This time at the lovely Panke in Berlin Wedding as a monthly club night. Every last friday of the month. This event I did for 3 years until April 2014. 

Work in Music: 
I started working in the music ‚Äì biz also very early - in the very early 90ies in Munich where I started the booking agency around the Label Disko B and the Club Ultraschall. (Artists: DJ Hell, Blake Baxter, Abe Duque, Patrick Pulsinger and many more).

In ‚Äô96 a major label called and I moved to Hamburg to promote great artists like: Goldie, Roni Size, Money Mark, Portishead etc‚Ä¶ Parallel I had a weekly residency at Club Tempelhof, where I played my ‚ÄúFreestyle‚Äù program. Of course way too early, so after 1 year it was done. After my experience with a Major Label I did some freelance jobs till the next milestone in my live started: Press Speaker Assistant of the Loveparade ‚Äô99 in Berlin. I moved to Berlin, worked for the Sonar Kollektiv (Label collective of Jazzanova) until a friend of mine hired me to help him setting up the Software Startup go_Disko*. I was really happy there but one day I received a mail from iTunes, where they offered me the Job as ‚ÄúHead of Editorial‚Äù for the German iTunes store. I started working there right after they opened in Germany ‚Äì in a team of 2 people ‚Äì for the next 3,5 years. Great Time it was!

After this great experience I was totally focussed on the topic ‚Äúfuture of things.. ‚Äù and changed after some nice little jobs for BPitch Control, Puppetmastaz etc..from the music biz to the online biz. Cause at this time (and most is still)  every cool new thing was / is forbidden by law in Germany. I organized the re:publica 09 (started 6 weeks before and put all strings together) and now I‚Äôm an Online Project Manager, have my 2 own blogs, still do DJing and diggin music. I‚Äôm very curious about new strategies, recommendation systems, apps and have a dream of an aggregated platform with something like a semantic search, where you can find everything about your fave artist, movie etc.. Where you can listen for free, pay for a download or even pay per stream. All in one platform. Since 2 years I‚Äôm a paying Spotify customer. Started in Sept. 2007 using Soundcloud for my DJ mixes. All my 23 Mixes where played 15.000 times, downloaded 3.100 times in 107 countries since than. I dig music all through the internet, get recommendations from my social network, share my findings and pay wherever I can pay. I‚Äôm a very proud owner of 15.000 Vinyls and have around 160 GB well sorted music on my hard drive.

‚Äì> My philosophy: Sharing means caring ‚Äì knowledge is growing when its shared.

BIO ‚Äì MAD MATS (Local Talk, Raw Fusion, Basic Fingers) Stockholm

First off, we‚Äôre talking about a real DJs DJ...period! He got the technical skills, musical history and a never-ending hunger for underground dance music. Basically, he got the full package!

Stockholm born Mad Mats endeavours started in the mid 80‚Äôs when he left his break dancing career (Swedish champ 1985!) to become one of the resident DJs at Stockholm‚Äôs early hip hop jams circa 1986. In 1988 during a trip to London to experience the thriving rare groove scene he opened up his music senses to leftfield rhythms and the alternative club culture. After starting producing hip hop in the late 80s Mats started collecting ‚Äúbreaks & samples‚Äù which introduced him to the whole spectrum of underground dance music. This wild cocktail of music styles made him one of the most popular and respected DJs in the Stockholm club scene during the 90s and is today a DJ with a solid cult status in Sweden.

Nowadays Mats is working hard with his three labels Local Talk, Basic Fingers and Raw Fusion. All have their own identity but always with a touch of Mad Mats. As a side project Mats also got a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù finger in the mysterious little label called GAMM...hush hush ok ;) .

By night when Mats is not touring the world spinning at various clubs and festivals he‚Äôs running the legendary Raw Fusion club in the heart of Stockholm. The club has been running strong for over 13 years with diverse guest DJs such as Theo Parrish, J-Dilla (RIP), Kerri Chandler, Peanut Butter Wolf, Gilles Peterson, Sbtrkt, Carl Craig, Jazzanova, Laurent Garnier and Dixon to name only a few. The club is still throwing parties and has become one of the most important underground club institutions in Scandinavia. Besides the Raw Fusion party Mats also runs a new house night called Unhous where he together with Tooli (24:hrs) and Jonas K delivers the best in underground house music at Stockholms hottest club venue Under Bron (Under The Bridge). Recent guest DJs includes Jimpster, Bassfort and Andreas Saag to name a few.

With a DJ career running over 25 years, we know that this open-minded b-boy has got some serious skills and have on numerous occasions been voted Sweden‚Äôs best DJ. Last time was in 2009 when he got voted number one by leading club site Clubstockholm.se where he received over 15000 votes. With a remarkable and open-minded variation you can easily find Mad Mats spinning at house/techno, hip hop/r&b or retro soul, funk & disco clubs. But most of all he prefers a freestyle session where he can mix everything up...Mad Mats style! He has been there, done that and wants to return for more. Check him out if you can, you wont be disappointed!

Along the way, he founded the gay art rock band Fagbash, and was one half of disco-pop band Captain Comatose.
Soon after arriving in Berlin, Snax began producing his solo releases from the ground up, writing and performing mostly all instruments and vocals himself. In 2004 came the release of the electronic soul manifesto From The Rocking Chair To The Stage (Mental Groove). Fall 2006 saw Snax sound incorporating more acoustic elements on his second long-player Love Pollution (TNT/Four Music), described by Snax as being ‚Äúabout love, loss, bitchiness and finally redemption.‚Äù The remix for the single, ‚ÄòHoneymoon‚Äôs Over‚Äô by Konrad Black was hailed by many as the anthem of Summer 2007. Returning to his electronic funk roots, Snax released two EP‚Äôs on UK‚Äôs defDrive followed by Special Guest Star, the flagship release on his own label, Random Records. Reflecting on his rich and rewarding career and the myriad creative interactions he‚Äôs experienced, Snax founded the House Of Snaxine. To them he dedicated Up And Coming Children (Random Records) in 2010; an exciting return to form with an eye to the future. 
Snax‚Äôs performances and DJ sets deliver provocation, sleaze and fun. The result is a direct connection with the audience. His various collaborators  have included Jamie Lidell, Peaches, Joey Arias and Terranova to name a few. Upon supporting The Scissor Sisters throughout Europe as their opening act, Snax was described be front man Jake Shears as ‚Äúa one man fro freak show not to be missed.‚Äù

During the two decades of his career, his work toured internationally with the Alias, L‚ÄôAlakran and Teatro Malandro companies; he published a string of dancefloor-suited gems on some of the best English and German electronic labels (Crosstown Rebels, Connaisseur, Treibstoff, Kalk Pets, Alphahouse); and he set up duos with some cult figures of the electronic scene (AG/BG with Detroit Grand Pubahs, John Keys with Dandy Jack).

His latest project, Andr√®s Garcia & The Ghost, came into being in 2011 with the release of Haunted Love, an album spanning between lusciously melancholic, electronic pop, funky romanticism and a hint of jazz. A multimedia live show stemmed from the record, premiered at the prominent Geneva festival La B√¢tie on the same year.

Anu Pillai aka Freeform Five is one of those rare artists. A veteran of the dance music scene, he started to release records on the seminal labels Classic, Glasgow Underground and NRK back in 1998. He soon worked his way into the premier league of remixers, producing some of the most stunning reworks of the last decade for artists as diverse as N*E*R*D, Brian Wilson, X-Press 2 & David Byrne, Jamie Lidell, Justin Timberlake, Felix da Housecat and The Killers ‚Äì as well as work for cutting edge labels like Warp and Cocoon.¬†
He‚Äôs spent a small fortune carbon offsetting his airmiles with DJ & live appearances at Fabric / The End / Ministry of Sound (London), Space / Manumission / Ibiza Rocks (Ibiza), Cocoon (Frankfurt), Watergate / Cookies / Week End (Berlin), Razzmatazz (Barcelona), D-Edge (Sao Paolo), Womb / Ageha / Unit (Tokyo), Rex / Social Club / Paris Paris (Paris), LAX (LA), and Lux (Lisbon) ‚Äì plus tours of Scandinavia, Australia, America, and all the major festivals, including Glastonbury, T In The Park, Benicassim, Parklife and Pukkelpop. Anu has also released Freeform Five‚Äôs debut album ‚ÄòStrangest Things‚Äô on Atlantic records, two massive DJ mix albums, ‚ÄòBisous Bisous II‚Äô & ‚ÄòMisch Masch‚Äô and contributed to several of Kitsun√©‚Äôs genre defining compilations.
Following a relentless touring schedule, Anu decided to take a break from Freeform Five a few years back to concentrate on writing, producing & remixing for the likes of Ladyhawke, Santigold, William Orbit, Eve, Lana Del Rey, Deadmau5, Little Boots and Roisin Murphy amongst others. He also set up boundary-pushing label Perspex Recordings with releases from Chicago legend Derrick Carter, French rockers Poney Poney /Jamaica (produced by Xavier from Justice) and Swedish auteur ‚ÄòThe Subliminal Kid‚Äô (producer of Fever Ray & Matthew Dear) along with remixes by like minded friends such as Gabriel Ananda, Riton, Tomboy & Riva Starr.¬†
Anu has always thought outside the box. His remix of Isolee's 'Beau Mot Plage' redefined the art of remixing, juxtaposing the micro synthesis of the original with intricate Afro & Latin polyrhythms, creating a bona-fide house music classic. Remixes of Llorca's ""Indigo Blues"" and Isolee's ""Brazil.com"" fused west African kora, Indian orchestrations and classical harp within a house music template and on the Freeform Five track 'Eeeeaaooww' he merged disco licks with Bounty Killer's dancehall patois.¬†
Anu returned to the scene by collaborating with Gambian griot and master musician Juldeh Camara (a member of Robert Plant's Sensational Space Shifters band) for ""Weltareh"" on Eskimo recordings. ¬†He also hooked up with Berlin's white hot Exploited crew for the jacking pure analog ""Brandy Alexander."" And now on ""Leviathan"" he teams up with the legendary Roisin Murphy for an exercise in irresistible vocal power and anthemic feel good house.
Tom Trago, Compuphonic and Cage & Aviary join the the stellar list of super talented artists who've been invited to remix Freeform Five tracks (following on from Tiefschwarz, Radioslave, Alter Ego, Lindstrom, Mylo, M.A.N.D.Y, Switch, Ewan Pearson, Jackson & His Computer Band, Prins Thomas and Maurice Fulton to name a few) along with a stunning re-work from Anu himself.

Already from the start music has played a big part in his life, coming from a musical family and attending the local music institute at an early age. Starting out focusing on the guitar and the piano, he later on started making hip-hop music. In 2006 he moved to Stockholm, Sweden where he met his compatriot Jani Inkeroinen from psy trance group Trollscientists who got him interested in electronic music. For the moment Jonas is studying Audio engineering ‚Äì Sound design and music production at SAE Institute Stockholm, but he‚Äôll be moving back to Finland soon, where he‚Äôs planning to found his own studio.
As an artist Jonas aims at creating minimalistic electro house for the dancefloors, with a sound focusing on fat bass lines and electro. Jonas hasn‚Äôt realeased anything yet, still looking for an adequate record label that shares his musical visions.

Muallem has always focused his attentions on the communal experience of dancing. This love was incubated in Munich, a city where Muallem first found himself sneaking into clubs at the tender age of 15. Over the years, his career saw him produce and perform under many guises and live across the world exploring local scenes and movements whilst refining his own DJ craft. However, it was when he returned to Munich after over a decade abroad, that Muallem was able to make his biggest mark on electronic music and its community. 

Playing a key role at influential Munich club Bob Beaman, Muallem was the creative director and programmer until May 2016. Also occupying a resident slot, he rapidly gained a reputation for a vast depth of music knowledge, which he uses knitting together house, techno and disco jams drawn from across the decades. His immersion within the Munich scene saw him busy running SMiLE Festival and affiliated Art of Dance nights until 2017 when he opened Blitz, one of Europe‚Äôs most respected club institutions. Here his progressive music policy, dynamic understanding of audio acoustics as well as an appreciation of the relationship between DJ and dance floor came to the fore. 

His desire to open venues and create a blank canvas for artists to express themselves was also driven by wanting to create a club that makes you part of something, a community and a place of freedom for the people who are fleeing the everyday. His DJing feeds this atmosphere of escapist hedonism and elevates the crowd to those transcendent dance floor moments. As the creative director of Blitz, the risks he takes with club programming are reflected in the risks he takes with his selection while DJing, a talent which places him amongst the scenes established taste making luminaries. Always working to find unheard cuts or records others might stay away from, it was the educated crowds at Bob Beaman and Blitz that served as the perfect foil for him to master this craft as a selector.

With regular and mostly long lasting closing sets at Panorama Bar as well as landmark sets at Robert Johnson, Printworks, DC:10, Rex Club, IFZ, Bar Americas and Shelter, his international profile has grown to match his domestic reputation as a DJ with a revered approach to track selection and ability to inject ecstatic vibes into any party. Performing internationally allowed him to realise that a great experience on the dancefloor is such a universal happening that the location doesn‚Äôt matter. 

Another milestone on Muallems storied timeline is the creation of LGBTQI+ night Cruise. Finding its home at Blitz, Cruise is a project close to his heart that he created with two close companions, Gio and Werner. The idea for the night was established over the years out of the desire to promote inclusivity for all with a forward thinking approach to music, something which has been a defining trend throughout Muallems career. Muallem considers the night as ‚Äúblueprint for what Blitz is about‚Äù, no wonder it‚Äôs international acclaim goes hand in hand with the club. 

He understands the primary purpose of a club and a DJ is to make people dance TOGETHER, so as a performer he is one that lets the music do the work for him. Selecting tunes that feel familiar yet new, Muallem has a connection with the crowd that only an experienced dancefloor campaigner can attain.


In 2020, Muallem took the chance of nightlife‚Äôs closure due to the global pandemic in the form of creating his very own musical imprint, CHILDHOOD. So far, the label released singles by DJ Deep & Don Williams as well as albums by Mr. G and CYRK.",4862,3,,,0,291,user,2021-11-08T13:20:09Z,,10,1,muallem,https://soundcloud.com/muallem,7,,48,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/291,soundcloud:users:291,muallem,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:291,artist-stations:291,creator-pro-unlimited,soundcloud:users:291,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:109796766', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000000291-6nXeMS-original.jpg'}]",,False,True,False,

From raw disco to beautiful, refined techno, and stopping at every tempo and mood between and beyond, Still Music and its sublabels Past Due and Love For Music have found room to include artists both established and new, releasing what can only be described as GOOD music. 

This is the natural way of working for Mr. Derradji, who moved to the US in 2000 and cut his teeth working with various record shops and electronic music distributors in Chicago. He decided to launch Still Music in 2004, with the inaugural release featuring Amp Fiddler from Detroit remixing Patchworks from France. With this template set, Still Music went on to release music from veteran dance producers such as Rick Wilhite and Gerald Mitchell, while also stretching out into other genres on Randolph‚Äôs ‚ÄúLonely Eden‚Äù album and Seun Kuti‚Äôs political afrobeat on ‚ÄúThink Africa‚Äù. Still also dropped the In The Dark compilation, showcasing the then-emerging Detroit house sound and featuring the production debut of Keith Worthy, which was touted as Groove Magazine‚Äôs #1 release the month it came out. These credentials have earned Still Music ‚ÄúLabel of the Month‚Äù status in XLR8R magazine and on leading dance music site Resident Advisor. 

Not satisfied with Still Music‚Äôs impressive breadth and depth, Jerome also launched two highly successful sublabels to compliment the main label. Past Due records is the place for long-forgotten independent disco and funk gems to be unearthed, reissued, and remixed by modern producers, bringing artists like DIT and Greyship Daviz into the spotlight they (wrongfully!) never achieved the first time around. Love For Music (also known as Stilove4music) is the label dedicated to more underground sounds, from disco edits to lo-fi house and techno madness.",10827,55,Jerome,Jerome Derradji,0,294,user,2020-12-16T21:33:10Z,Derradji,2,1,stillmusic,https://soundcloud.com/stillmusic,53,,266,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/294,soundcloud:users:294,stillmusic,True,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:294,artist-stations:294,creator-pro-unlimited,,,,,False,True,True,

He is producing tunes with Henry L aka Henry L & Ingo S√§nger. Their sound is influenced by classic Detroit and Chicago House, which often flirts with Disco and Boogie. These mirror ball fantasies are joined by their Funk, Soul and Jazz stamped Hiphop roots. 

Ingo is also part of the duo Westpark Unit (with Herb LF) and runs the label Farside Records. 

From 1995 to 2004 he used to play on german radiostation WDR 1Live and founded the Treibhaus show that was quite influential for a lot of DJs & upcoming artists. Since 2010 he is back on air with a monthly radioshow on ByteFM. He played in almost every good club in Germany and of course different intl. DJ spots here and there. Sometimes you can find him playing with musicians (eg. harpist) as well.

‚ÄúFrankfurt native Andreas Baumecker aka nd_baumecker began his DJ career in 1991 in a bar called Romantica, located near the city‚Äôs main train station. The venue was run by legendary nightlife impresario Hans Romanov, who also operated Intimbar, where Baumecker would eventually move on to a short time later. It‚Äôs there that Ata and Heiko M/S/O from Playhouse took notice, inviting Baumecker to work as a buyer for their record store Delirium and offering him a residency at their seminal WildPitchClub night at the Club Nachtleben. Soon, Baumecker was regularly playing Frankfurt‚Äôs numerous electronic music venues (Box, XS, Music Hall, Dorian Grey), before moving on to Heidelberg, where he promoted the club night HD800 together with Dirk Mantei aka D-Man. After a short stop in Mannheim, regular guest DJ sets at Berghain / Panorama Bar predecessor club OstGut in Berlin, and establishing his own label Freundinnen Audio, nd_baumecker moved to the German capital in 2004. There he not only picked up a residency at Panorama Bar inside the newly opened Berghain but also started a job as the club‚Äôs in-house booker.
Stylistically, Baumecker covers a truly broad spectrum of dance music, refusing to be limited by genre: ""A well known choreographer once said: 'Surprise is important.‚Äô I think this approach describes my DJ style best. I‚Äôm constantly oscillating between disco, house, techno, electro, broken beats and pop. Ultimately, I‚Äôm open to anything ‚Äì from brute force to tender. I see the dance floor an experimental field: If you manage to really capture the crowd, you can do almost anything with them."" Of course, the flow of tracks and resolving musical differences plays a key role in achieving just that, and few DJs are as adept at uniting fundamentally disparate sounds, different keys, different rhythms and different atmospheres. ‚ÄûIf something sounds truly new to me they give me a jolt. Also, dance music should have a good portion of funk and, in a way, it needs to sound like disco, whatever the style. I like vocals a lot. In my opinion they are the most important and significant bits you‚Äôre taking home after a good night out; they‚Äôre the most memorable.""
Since 2010 nd also produces with Sam Barker as Barker & Baumecker. The duo have released four 12‚Äùs and two albums on Ostgut Ton, operating musically between dancefloor and spiraling left field electronics. Finally, 2018 sees release of nd_baumecker‚Äôs Panorama Bar 07 DJ mix.‚Äù",32038,857,Andreas,Andreas Baumecker,0,314,user,2021-08-23T21:41:11Z,Baumecker,136,23,ndbaumecker,https://soundcloud.com/ndbaumecker,1,,13,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/314,soundcloud:users:314,nd_baumecker,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:314,artist-stations:314,creator-pro-unlimited,,,,,False,True,False,

Don Rogall has been creating various new music movements for 3 decades with incomparable artistic freedom, delivering the soundtrack of subculture in over 120 venues in his town Berlin and over 100 genre-defining clubs in 18 countries all over the world. 

From the jazzier beginnings in the depth of Rare grooves to sampling culture and the avant-garde of 90s electronica & Headz to Raves & House, Dub, Drum'n'Bass and all types of breakbeats to various live-sound systems. 
He is heavily into the early beginnings of DJ roots of 50s and 60s music based on Rhythm, Blues, Soul & early Rock'n'Roll, as well as pop punk-culture to many influences from around the globe and a passion for Exotica music and soundtrack related stuff. 

Don has contributed to Arts Festivals, created soundtracks for his own Burlesque, Variety & Circus Sideshows, as well as many fashion shows of established designers, programming playlists for corporate, bars, hotels, performing artists, mixed sound for motion pictures, taught upcoming artists and DJs (also at the Berlin DJ Music Academy) and had countless own releases in various musical genres with several bands. With one of them, Nylon,  he headlined the German Spiegel magazine for modernizing German music. 
The creativity is flourishing. He was an original member of the label-trust Sonar Kollektiv in '97, one of the biggest independent publishers from Berlin and produced one of the labels most successful acts, Micatone, among others. 

Don produced & moderated about 200 radio-shows for different stations and curated festivals at the Volksb√ºhne Berlin. He worked as a booker and Dj at many influential clubs, held residencies at Bassy Club, Delicious Doughnuts, WMF, Cookies, Maria, Lovelite as well as playing at other legendary venues of all sizes and genres like Mojo Club Hamburg, Tresor Berlin, E-werk Berlin, Distillery Leipzig, Batofar Paris, Stammheim Kassel, Dachkantine Z√ºrich, Home Sweet Home New York, Mercati Generali Italy, White Trash Berlin, Festsaal Kreuzberg - and was in the line-up at Big Chill Festival England, Sonne Mond Sterne Festival, Printemps de Bourges France, Schauspielhaus D√ºsseldorf, Volksb√ºhne Berlin, Konzerthaus Berlin, Urban Jazz Festival Bremen, Zeltmusikfestival and many, many more.

He is well known for his particularly funky use of Roland‚Äôs sh101 analog synth, and for his particularly emotional and personal melodies and harmonies.

There is no doubt that after more than 20 years of teaching himself production processes, complex midi programming and harmonies, Fabrice‚Äôs sound is unique and recognisable among the thousands of weekly techno releases.

Demonstrations of these skills appear on the cr√®me de la cr√®me of electronic music labels such as KMS (Kevin Saunderson), Planet-e (Carl Craig), Submerge, R&S, Third Ear, 7th City Records (Dan Bell), F-Communications (Laurent Garnier) , Versatile, Classic, Compost, Subject Detroit, Motech, Raygun, Playhouse Records, Kanzleramt (Heiko Laux), 70 Drums (Ken Ishii), Clone, Trapez ltd and so on...An exceptional discography into mythic labels, into history of electronic music.
By the end of 1998, after his first DJ and production experiences, under the Interwaves and Bug Orchestra nicknames, Fabrice was elevated to the ranks of the Detroit musical elite by Mad Mike himself, thanks to his classic remix of E-Dancer‚Äôs Banjo track on KMS: ‚ÄúFabrice is a part of Detroit music's history by being the first white producer to record on KMS, and the first double groove recording from NSC‚Äù.
Fabrice has built a solid discography and reputation, confirmed by his reknowned appearances at the world‚Äôs best clubs & festival line ups such as Panorama Bar-Berlin, Fabric - London, Womb-Tokyo, Detroit Fuse-In Festival, Fuse - Brussels, Loft - Barcelona, Sub Club - Glasgow, The End - London, Sonar Festival, world famous official Montreux Jazz Festival, Bourges festival (On stage with Jean-Michel Jarre ), to name but a few. One of the highlight of Fabrice dj career is the paper into Detroit Free press where his performance was voted best dj Set of 2005‚Äôs Detroit Fuse-in Festival.
Fabrice also collaborated and remixed some artists like Laurent Garnier, Kevin Saunderson, Agoria, DJ Hell, Ken Ishii, Kenny Hawkes, Rob Mello, Frederic Galliano, Chymera, Tr√ºby Trio‚Ä¶
After his last Soul Designer's album on Third Ear (2007), Fabrice decided to take a bit of a break from music and concentrate on some educational projects. Nevertheless, he released his classic Purple Raw EP on Versatile in that period, as well as some own EPs on R&S, Subject Detroit, .. next to a few remixes. Over the last few months however, Fabrice quietly prepared the celebration of 20 years of music by producing a new album with the idea to make a strong ‚Äúcome back‚Äù with fresh material for late 2014.
And when Carl Craig first heard ""Galactic Soul Odysseys"", he instantly decided to invite Fabrice to join Planet E's prestigious family. Once again, Fabrice work is entering history of music through one of the most respected labels from the techno community.
Fabrice is really excited to be back on tour for live performances around the globe and to present that new material to his fans...

As Jean-Michel Jarre said in an interview for MTV : ""What is touching me in Fabrice Lig's career is the way he is following his own line, without caring about trends, and that's the path an artist should follow. It is not post Detroit, it's an emotion""

For him being a DJ (or a producer) is not a final objective, but a means to party, to share music and feelings. A way to give back to the music scene that gave him so much in his life.

Miles away from nowadays inter-continental DJ circuit he prefers to party and to share his music in intimate clubs and at their own ‚Äûbag of goodies‚Äú nights. Music is the passion that drives his every heartbeat and it shows in every project he‚Äôs been involved so far. Driven by the feel of the occasion and as likely to draw for a classic house record as throwing a disco curveball or dropping one of his African bombs into the mix, he makes his true passion for dance music and culture show in every selection.

He started DJing in 1994, throwing small house parties in a rather quirky location, before teaming up with Emanuela De Luca running their ‚Äûbag of goodies‚Äú nights up until today. He also published a dance-music print magazine called ‚Äûouk‚Äú from 1996-2003 which supplied the music communities in Germany, Switzerland and Austria with then scarce (the internet was just around the corner) yet desperately needed information and stories about the music scene. He also shared several music columns in the local newspaper.

In 2004 he started making his own music under the moniker of ‚ÄûDancing Djedi‚Äú releasing a quite successful 12‚Äú called ‚ÄûBody Music‚Äú on the Swedish ‚ÄûG.A.M.M.‚Äú label.

  ""Peelie, Charlie, Gilles, Annie...Nick Luscombe has become one of those radio titans."" (Straight No Chaser) 
                  
For over 15 years Nick Luscombe has been committed to seek out and share quality, modern music across many genres, styles and sounds through his radio shows and DJ sets. XFM provided a platform for his popular Flomotion show from 2000 to 2006, and it then moved to the programme's current home at Resonance FM.  

Nick also presents the Sony Award-winning BBC Radio 3 Late Junction programme and is a regular guest on Monocle 24 and BBC 6 Music.

An exclusive monthly in-flight version of Flomotion can also be heard on all British Airways flights. 

As a globe-trotting radio producer, he has produced radio shows that have taken him far afield to discover the sounds of Cuba, Jamaica, Japan, South Africa and Morocco. He also produced BBC Radio 2 series `The Sound of The City', presented by one of Nick‚Äôs broadcsting heroes, the late Charlie Gillett.

Nick was also instrumental in the production of David Sylvian‚Äôs `Amplified Gesture'. Nick interviewed Christian Fennesz, Sachiko M., Toshimaru Nakamura, Evan Parker, Eddie Pr√©vost, Keith Rowe, John Tilbury, Otomo Yoshihide, among others for the project. It stands as one of the most definitive films about improvised music ever made.

Nick‚Äôs passionate curation and promotion of countless live music and DJ showcases at venues as varied as Cargo in Shoreditch, the Royal Festival Hall and the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, has, over the past decade, helped provide a dynamic platform for new artists and his popular radio shows have helped inspire a new generation of electronic music producers.

Nick‚Äôs club DJing has taken him to venues throughout the UK and Europe and around the world to Singapore, Scandinavia, Japan, the USA and India. He continues to maintain a number of London residencies across the city.

Nick has DJed and hosted stages at many outdoor festivals and events such as the Big Chill Festival, Big Chill Goa, Secret Garden Party, Bestival, Green Man, Somerset House outdoor film screenings, Thames Festival Main Stage and `Freedom Sunset‚Äô near Tokyo. Nick was also selected to represent the best of British DJs at a British Council week-long event in India.

His eclectic DJ sets represent a feast of musical styles, each a one-off and tailor made for that night. His eclectic deep club sounds blend moody and futuristic house with electronica, jazz, techno, soul, disco and hip hop.

From her highly lauded collaboration with Sasha ‚ÄòF√∂rbindelse‚Äô that scored an Essential New Tune, to her stunning debut on Kompakt‚Äôs Speicher series ‚ÄòTears‚Äô and the relaunch of her Power Plant label with the exquisite ‚ÄòAphelion‚Äô EP, her elegant take on house and techno continues to captivate.

Power Plant stands for freedom and is a breeding ground for La Fleur‚Äôs various creative projects. It‚Äôs birthed the Power Plant ‚ÄòElements‚Äô fashion line and also seen the Swedish artist explore her passion for visual arts sourcing illustrators and painters for the label‚Äôs cover slicks.

Special music creations come in spades. There‚Äôs the classic ‚ÄòFlowerhead‚Äô that launched Power Plant and the iconic ‚ÄòNightflow‚Äô and ‚ÄòArms Around‚Äô EPs, remixed by Kenny Larkin and Carl Craig respectively. Superb original material has dropped on Truesoul, Last Night On Earth and Watergate Records. On the remix tip, she‚Äôs worked her magic on Sasha, Kerri Chandler and Damian Lazarus & Ancient Moons.

The former Mixmag breakthrough artist is in high demand for her DJ skills, buoyed by a critically acclaimed Essential Mix last summer. Recent and upcoming gig highlights include Sonus Festival, Tomorrowland, Melt! Festival, Junction 2, Ultra Music Festival Miami, Resistance Ibiza, Lollapalooza Stockholm, Fusion, Creamfields, Loveland, Warehouse Project and the tastemaker favourite Department Festival on home soil in Stockholm.",51142,84,La Fleur,La Fleur,0,379,user,2021-03-10T15:32:37Z,,202,39,lafleur,https://soundcloud.com/lafleur,23,,116,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/379,soundcloud:users:379,lafleur,True,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:379,artist-stations:379,creator-pro-unlimited,soundcloud:users:379,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:116001219', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000000379-PvdSAu-original.jpg'}]",,False,True,True,

With parents that played music loud to him as he went off to sleep as a baby (so he wouldn‚Äôt be woken when they had parties) you could say his musical education started young. His guitarist father played in folk clubs alongside legends like the late John Martyn and brought him up on a wide-ranging musical diet from Steely Dan to Billy Cobham.

Starting out aged 3 with chopsticks and plastic topped tubs for drums Jesse swiftly moved up to a miniature drum kit aged seven, learnt how to play his Dad‚Äôs guitar and self-taught himself piano ‚Äì by his early teens he was a multi-instrumentalist. Then armed with a Tascam 4-track tape recorder, a classic Juno-60 and a TR909 (bought in a classified ad for ¬£75) ‚Äì the world of ‚Äúoverdubbing‚Äù had been discovered.

He grew up through the original phase of electro and hip hop and would regularly spend Saturday afternoons in Canterbury, Kent ‚Äúpopping and breaking‚Äù to Streetsounds ‚ÄúElectro‚Äù albums with school best-friend ‚Äì legendary soul star Omar. Having become obsessed with ‚Äúthe recording process‚Äù he made sure his week of school ‚Äúwork experience‚Äù was spent at a local recording studio and saved enough pocket money to record his first demo there with a Linndrum and Juno 106. At a later date he did a recording course at Goldsmiths College, London.

Having crafted his art the next decade went on to see him release numerous recordings under various project names from Ultravibe to Stratospheric for labels such as Universal, Om Records, Hed Kandi, Shanachie, Internal Bass and more. He has also had music used in various TV shows like ‚ÄòBones‚Äô and ‚ÄòGrand Prix‚Äô.

Due to that broad musical diet Jesse has never been content with sticking strongly to just one musical genre and whenever he gets the itch he‚Äôll jump from soul to electronica to house to Brazilian to jazz to folk and beyond ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs deep, if it‚Äôs quality ‚Äì I‚Äôll likely be into it. DJ sets and personal listening vary a great deal but generally I always fall back to some form of deep soul and a jazz chord.‚Äù

Although working on numerous projects, Positive Flow has become Jesse‚Äôs main vehicle and has won critical acclaim and rotation from all the heavy-hitters like Gilles Peterson, Michael R√ºtten, Rainer Tr√ºby, MCDE, Laurent Garnier and more‚Ä¶

‚ÄúFlow Lines‚Äù, his debut album for TDR dropping late 2012, features an array of talent in the vocal arena from British soul supremo and old school friend Omar to Stacy Epps, Colonel Red, Andre Espeut, Vanessa Freeman, Heidi Vogel (Cinematic Orchestra) and more.

From the soul-laden future club classic ‚ÄúDo What I Do‚Äù through the brokenbeat Azymuth tinged ‚ÄúOrange & Brown‚Äù out to the epic deep spiritual offerings of ‚ÄúUniversal Truth‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúFlow Lines‚Äù is a rich tapestry of organic electronica interwoven with real strings ‚Äì a hallmark of classic LPs.",3813,266,Jesse,Jesse Reuben Wilson,0,400,user,2020-07-11T17:38:07Z,Reuben Wilson,116,9,positiveflow,https://soundcloud.com/positiveflow,4,,24,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/400,soundcloud:users:400,Positive Flow,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:400,artist-stations:400,free,soundcloud:users:400,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:104078409', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000000400-oWPBNL-original.jpg'}]",,False,False,False,

They met during a 'nightflight' in a Viennese bar and found they had many musical similarities. The emerging fusion marked the beginning of many Club sessions, which, in cooperation with several guest performers, had the audience dancing wildly.

The wonderful mixture between Jesse's longstanding live jazz experience as a vocalist and Gerald's exquisite choice of sound and musical background as DJ and guitarist made the duo an insider tip within the Viennese Club Scene.

While Jesse, gained recognition with his former group 'Reposado' and current formation 'Now Pfow b.d.d.', Gerald co-produced several tracks with 'Freedom Satellite', a band from the 'Vienna Scientists Recordings' collective.

Boogiewood's sounds range from jazzy hip-hop beats, groove/funk breaks, downbeat to latin/brasil house with influences by the early jazz/latin/funk scene of the 50-70s.

The Morning Show
‚ÄúOne the best and biggest surprises for me this year was The New Law‚Äôs releases‚Ä¶beautiful, emotional, cinematic‚Ä¶  .Its near perfect‚Äù
The Stranger Review
Dave Segal ‚Äì The Stranger
‚ÄúAdam Straney and Justin Neff‚Äîproduce deftly arranged, orchestrally inclined hiphop that evokes Ninja Tune‚Äôs glory years and Portishead‚Äôs doomed-romance aura (sans Beth Gibbons‚Äôs ruined croons, obviously). Hints of J Dilla‚Äôs clipped, staccato beatmaking also color the New Law‚Äôs tracks, which often demonstrate a cinematic scope and keenly emotive sense of atmosphere. URB picked them for its Next 1,000 Artists feature, and damn if the L.A.-based mag isn‚Äôt on point with that choice.‚Äù
URB Mag Review
URB magazine / URB.com (selected THE NEW LAW as Top Next 1,000 Artists)
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs refreshing to find a talented new ambient electronic artist. This duo is versatile as can be. They‚Äôve been toiling in the Seattle underground for three years, now finally preparing to release their sophomore album. From the surreal saxophone of ‚ÄúSeattle Lights‚Äù to the foreboding death march of ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Gates,‚Äù they paint pictures with sound. Ambient is a word that‚Äôs thrown around a lot. The New Law has proven that they know the meaning.‚Äù
80bpm.net Review
Kaska Paluch (editor-in-chief ‚Äì www.80bpm.net)
‚ÄúThe New Law is one of the best albums from underground I‚Äôve ever gotten.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you remember the movie HARDWARE, the album cover might get you thinking of a sort of Bladerunner apocalypse sound. You might be right, but The New Law is way better than such a simplification. Really nice work!‚Äù

Sven Jozwiak‚Äôs fascination for electronic music grew from a close affinity to Berlin‚Äôs lively electro scene. Years of clubbing, dancing and listening to what the city had on offer lead to an urge to participate himself. He wanted to become a DJ, so he bought some turntables at the age of 22 and began his career in the MOMA summer of 2006 after spontaneously taking over the decks at one of the many legendary Berlin afterhours. It worked out and his passion for DJing had been awakened.

He was able to improve his skills through playing at parties like Klangspiel and the famous Berlin HOMESWEETHOME, as well as at other events organized by the KASSETTE label. Soon just playing music wasn‚Äôt enough anymore and so he started to produce his own tracks. Two years later in 2008 his first track, recorded in cooperation with Tassielo Ippenberger (Pan-Pot), was published at 60SEC RECORDS. Tracks at labels like KASSETTE Rec, QT RECORDS, UPON YOU, Arera Sur and K:lender then followed and today he can now look back on an impressive discography. In the meantime his Djing brought him to legendary clubs such as Bar25, Kater Holzig and arenaclub as well as to festivals such as MELT!, with each performance enabling him to improve his skills continuously. 

When Sven takes to the turntables he enchants the audience with his mixture of house, tech-house and minimal vocal techno. The percussive, slightly melancholic and often playful sound takes control of Berlin‚Äôs dance floors and his feeling for beats and atmosphere is as impressive as his lively, passionate and beguiling performances. But he never loses sight of his goals. His favorite clubs are those with low ceilings that the audience can actually touch and thus provide an intimate and inspirational energy to his sets. Such an atmosphere inspires him to completely submerge himself into his DJ set. Then he doesn‚Äôt just play the tracks, he lives them. Sven about Sven: ‚ÄûDJing is the best, most fantastic, greatest thing. If all are dancing, kissing, just being happy and satisfied, having fun and simply enjoying the feeling of freedom, I am happy too.‚Äù 
He finds great enrichment within his musical work through close cooperation with other DJs and musicians. At the height of the Berlin electro scene‚Äôs ‚Äúminimal‚Äù hype he met Mert. Sven and Mert complement each other perfectly and they have been producing and experimenting with music since 2008. Together they are searching for one language to realize their vision of grooving dance floors in a certain special way. Their tracks are characterized by drifting, dynamic sounds in both the sparkling highs and the majestic solid bass depths. 
During a summer at Bar25, Sven found himself playing a DJing marathon set together with Empro. The congenial project  ‚ÄûEmpro & Jozwiak‚Äú went on to publish several tracks in 2010. Tracks from an upcoming project with Jan Fuchsberg will be published under the working name ‚ÄúSven Jozwiak & Fuchsberg‚Äú.

Our aim is to make interesting works accessable to a public and to promote the artists.
The most part of the releases will be musical works.
As we do not believe in cataloguing music, it is very hard for us to put any limits here. Nevertheless we are mainly interested in music from the field of minimal techno, electronica or clicks'n'cuts.
However, the focus is always on originality and acting on one's own initiative, so the question of style becomes secondary.

She has dedicated much time and study to both jewish music and all kinds of popular genres from jazz to electronic music. She lived in Hungary, Germany, Israel and in the Netherlands, but she also visited the US for further studies of spiritual music. 

Today she mixes world music with rap and jazzy sound in projects like ‚ÄúHagesher‚Äù or ‚ÄúZuboly‚Äù. She also worked with the Dj-pair ‚ÄúSavages y Suefo‚Äù recording liturgical text on electronic beat. 
Her band ‚ÄúShkayach‚Äù - playing traditional jewish music in the past - transformed a few years after she returned from her studies in Berlin into the more free fusional Jazz-Klez project ‚ÄúFlora Polnauer And The Promised Band‚Äù.
She was singer of funky-hiphop band ‚ÄúPlanet55‚Äù and she worked featuring ‚ÄúHippikiller‚Äù in a couple of songs.
In 2016, inspired by Marlene Dietrich, she came out with ‚ÄúMarlene Reload‚Äù that she co-produced with Bal√°zs Bihari (HippiKiller) and Zsolt Prieger (Anima Sound System).
Because of her love for the theatre she took part in many dance and theatre projects, in all kinds of roles.

Today she is a practising cantor both in Hungary and abroad, but she is also eager to widen her horizon when it comes to music, to open up to many genres, and to actually play with them‚Ä¶",197,119,Flora ,Flora  Polnauer,0,507,user,2017-04-08T01:37:11Z,Polnauer,5,1,pollyflow,https://soundcloud.com/pollyflow,1,,14,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/507,soundcloud:users:507,PollyFlow,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:507,artist-stations:507,free,soundcloud:users:507,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:11469880', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000000507-2vNNPD-original.jpg'}]",,False,False,False,

But when he moved to Hamburg and started touring the house clubs, he converted to electronic music. 1997 he moved to Berlin, bought two technics turntables and started his DJ career. Bookings in clubs like Wmf, Rio, Maria and regular appearances in Deep or ZMF were the result. With some of his friends he organized the ""neon nights"" parties, where acts like adamski or codec&flexor appeared. Since 2005 he is also producing his own music, and since he is playing live acts on a regular basis. At the start of 2007 he had to change his name from ""Hari Seldon"" to Harry Seldom cause some italian dude also released techno under the name ""Hari Seldon"".

Game music, too, but that's mostly work. I like to do my homework, myself.



Also sometime producer of <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/panssarijuna"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Panssarijuna</a>.  Fun, in Finnish!


<b><i>All right YEAH YEAH. WHAT ARE THESE?</i></b>

<b>THE CHIP</b> is just me fucking about with 80s tv cop themes. Hey, I calls them as I does themses.

<b>OUR SEASIDE ESCAPE</b> is a bunch of soundtrack-type songs (or sketches, if you want to be a dick about it :D ) that I've been working on lately. They're not for any specific small-town murder mystery serial, in fact they're not for anything. But for your enjoyment, that is. Hmm.

<b>PROPHECIES</b> collects all kinds of drones and ambiences. Like, ambient, you know, music for, I dunno, dystopian homes and farms? Or short films about love and loss in the time of silurians? Dunno, I just ... do this stuff.
ok, that's the <i>unreleased</i> latest stuff mostly dealt with, what about the rest? 

<b>FUTURE RUINS</b> is my latest album, out in iTunes, BeatPort, Spotify etc., it's pretty much Space Ambient ‚Äì but I like to think it's the <i>good kind</i>. Lots of found sound, droning drones and old-fashioned melody things, quite a bit of sound design hidden in there, too. Check it out.

<b>BOXY MUSIC</b>, is a bunch of small melody vignettes. Because making my next Big Albums (more on those later) started feeling like<i> work</i>, them being densely layered and processed, I started relaxing by doing little melodies during workday and evenings. Boxy is the result, simple childish melodies for young listeners. Not bad for working on your coloring book! <a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buy</a> it or just listen to it here, neither way breaks my bank.

<b>THE CAVE</b> is my neo-non-classical (or Bad Ambient, I dunno) diversion. it's far from easy listening. I got myself a bow and mallets and started bowing stuff, decided that making a minimal <i>cave exploration turned sci-fi </i>-soundtrack sounds like fun. It has been, for me, you can make up your own mind. You can buy it on <a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a>. If you do, I promise to waste all your money on Etsy stuff.

<b>FUTURE CITIES</b> is my forthcoming opus :D It was <i>supposed</i> to be a little record about the future that science once promised us, like eight songs. Don't let anybody tell me that I have problems sticking to my plans, ok? <i>After having released the first third in Future Ruins (up there)</i> I'm left with these two full-length albums, Cities and 

<b>FUTURE DREAMS</b> is the brightest timeline, the warmest of the Future records. If someone decides to publish them or I start to care.

Then there's Tea For Miss Yamaha (2001), my 300+ gram vinyl downtempo steal... I mean, sample-fest. Still very much loved among lovers of such things.

After that, I did some ambient albums and fun beats. You can guess which LP:s are which, they're all in my sets.

You can find almost all the previous albums for free here or on the <a href=""http://www.polyfonken.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>. Except the Zen Bound soundtracks, you have to go to <a href=""http://zenbound.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">zenbound.com</a> for those.

It‚Äôs been amazing twenty years since me and my friends started organizing illegal raves in the squat houses of Helsinki in early 90s. Most bizarre experience must have been DJing for Jean-Paul Gaultier and Helena Christensen at a Berlin fetish club Kit Kat after their first ever Berlin show. Most flashy ones have been entertaining the rich & famous of Hong Kong or Russia while warming up Chemical Brothers, Paul van Dyk or Underworld was something I‚Äôll never forget. From the venues I‚Äôve DJed Tresor in Berlin, Pacha in Ibiza, Ministry of Sound in London and CODE in Tokyo were special places to play.

My recording career started in 1998 with Slusnik Luna‚Äôs Nicklas Renqvist. ‚ÄòUnity‚Äò was signed to british Steelfish label and found it‚Äôs way to Gatecrasher and Renaissance compilations. Sasha and Oakenfold opened their Essential Mixes with it and Pete Tong played it on BBC Radio 1. Gigs with DJ Tiesto lead into signing to his Black Hole label while other releases include ‚ÄòEmbrace‚Äô on Five AM and ‚ÄòBeautiful‚Äò on Sential (finnish national singles chart #1). Most famous colaborations include ‚ÄòYearZero‚Äò together with Andy Moor, ‚ÄòGod‚Äôs Garden‚Äò together with David West and ‚ÄòZeitgeist‚Äò with Solarstone. My remixes include Aalto‚Äôs ‚ÄòRush‚Äò made together with Super8, Stage One remix made for Hooj Choons, Way Out West‚Äôs ‚ÄòKilla‚Äò and more recently a bootleg remix of Hans Zimmer‚Äôs ‚ÄòTime‚Äò from Inception soundtrack which Paul Oakenfold loved so much he did his own edit. In 2011 I released my third artist album ‚Äú20‚Äù which also celebrates my twenty years of DJing.

As promoters we have come a very long way from the days of illegal warehouse raves. Together with my friends, we have run Club Unity for over ten years, promoted Renaissance‚Äôs events in Helsinki and organized events called ‚ÄúPacifique‚Äù for almost 3000 people in a water park. We have had fun at 16 hour Sunday clubbing sessions at DTM and have brought Jose Padilla to Finland. We have organised events on boats, in parks, on ice-skating rinks and even did one of Finland‚Äôs first flash mobs: the infamous One Minute Raves. The longest set I‚Äôve ever played was 23 hours on New Year‚Äôs Day in 2010. To me electronic music and club culture has always been about open-mindness, unity amongst people and pushing the musical boundaries forward, whether it‚Äôs ambient concert in a park or full on rave in warehouse.

From the Club‚Äôs mentor Larry Levan Boris learned to believe in his musical intuition as well as a broad musical spectrum, which nowadays ranges from Disco, Hi-NRG, Post-Punk and (Kraut-) Rock to House and Techno, all of which Boris loves to throw into one set. ‚ÄûMusic was most important for Levan. He was uncompromising and he knew how to convey it. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to achieve, too, when I‚Äôm djing.‚Äú

Many years later, Boris became a resident at Panorama Bar‚Äôs first incarnation in Berlin, where he was able to build a loyal following by playing long sets lasting until noon. ‚ÄûThe crowd is always a lot more receptive for music at the end than at the beginning. That‚Äôs when I rather have the opportunity to present unusual stuff and that‚Äôs when I‚Äôm able to let my feelings run freely.‚Äú
After the old OstGut/Panorama Bar closed, Boris played in almost every club in Berlin, but when the follow up club Berghain opened its doors in 2004, he quickly focused on playing out here again. From 2005 till 2010 he had another musical platform, as he was taking care of the label Careless Records as an A&R. As a DJ, he is not exactly keen on refining a certain genre, but rather to push music with a certain twist.",28882,50,,,0,619,user,2021-10-27T20:13:19Z,,8,0,boris,https://soundcloud.com/boris,0,,25,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/619,soundcloud:users:619,Boris,True,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:619,artist-stations:619,creator-pro-unlimited,soundcloud:users:619,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:152135001', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000000619-YAYqGI-original.jpg'}]",,False,True,True,

This influenced him to change his take on music: putting aside the guitar, quitting the band he was playing in. One year later, he happened to start his DJ career in small venues around Zurich.

A long break from classic musicianship followed, with time mostly spent in clubs, studios and record stores till it was time for Demetrio to get re-involved by the end of the 90`s, and in 2001, he released his first white label record on his imprint M.A.R..

In 2002, he organized his first party ‚Äúvibrator 02‚Ä≥ on Zurich‚Äôs busiest weekend of the year: that of the Street Parade. It was an after hour on the following Sunday morning, featuring acts like Dixon, Peak Nick & Ilo and lot of others..

From 2005 on, his monthly nine hours net radio show m.a.r. was broadcasted via audioasyl.net.One year laters he founded the ‚Äúvollscharf ‚Äì wollscharf‚Äù after hour event series, aiming to bring to music to the people and the people to the lake side, where these outdoor parties were taking place. This series featured artists including Marshall Jefferson, Mike Huckaby, The Deep Dicks and a lot of others.

2007 saw the respected British label Third Ear getting interested in tracks by Demetrio, which were finally released in 2009 on the ‚ÄûTalk EP‚Äú. In 2008, the track ‚ÄûEleven‚Äú was released on the Drumpoet ‚Äúverse 2‚Ä≥12 inch, earning a lot of positive feedback.

Early 2009, he got the chance to remix one of Deep House‚Äôs legends, Chez Damier, the result of which was released in December 2009 on Mojuba‚Äôs G.O.D.2 . After that, Chez Damier and Demetrio joined forces as producers on several projects and as well as label joint venture between Chez`s Balance Alliance and Demetrio‚Äôs Enterbt Rec. The first collaboration to be released was the ‚ÄúAdventures in Barcelona‚Äù EP (the tracks credited to Timnah Sommerfeldt, ‚ÄûFeel Me Up‚Äú and a dub version of the same number, were in fact produced by Chez Damier and Demetrio Giannice), out on Balance Alliance/ Enterbt ‚Äì BA 006 in January. 2010.

2011 the second EP for Third Ear followed entitled ‚ÄûSlow‚Äú, as well as new productions due on his own Enterbt Records, some Remixes, he appeared on some VA Releases on Quarter Notes, Hizou or Snuff Trax to name a few. In the same year, he had the opportunity to produce and mix a R&B/Downtempo Album for a no name Band released for free and Digitally only.

After a little studio-break he decided to start to work on a Album for Balance (which is still in progress, to be released 2014) along with some remixes for the ones like Morris Audio City Sport Edition (Released Dec. 2012), the forthcoming Enterbt Black Edition and a lot of other hidden projects.

Recently he got the chance ti mix one of the Deep House Classic produced by Victor Simonelli i want you to know to be released in December 2013/January 2014 on Deep Down Slam. Again, there‚Äôs a lot more to come for 2014, but it‚Äôs not yet the moment to talk about all that.

A member of the Swedish electronic pop group, The Knife, Olof has been involved in different cultural projects where music plays a central role in communicating political beliefs. His solo project, Oni Ayhun, plays with stereotypical ideas and norms about gender in dance and experimental music.
 
Starting djing around 98' at local school parties, he ran his first club in high school and has been djing since. He started out playing Disco, House, Garage, and Drum n' bass playing more Hip Hop and R&B in the early 2000's. Following this was a long period of playing harder Techno and House, including EBM and Shranz. The last decade has seen him playing mostly throughout Europe when he's not too busy producing music in his Berlin studio.
 

Currently, as a DJ, Olof plays a mix of West African pop music, Kuduro, Acid, Hip Hop, R&B, and melodic Techno and House. 
 
He enjoys making fun edits and remixes to play in his sets. He recently remixed the Swedish Batucada group, Yacombe. You can hear it in the opening of his Rinse FM mix.
