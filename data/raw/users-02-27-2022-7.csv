Resolute, inspired, dedicated; he’s one of the most consistent selectors and supporters of the genre in every possible direction.

As a broadcaster he’s never been busier with regular shows on Mi-Soul, Subtle FM and DNB NYC allowing him to push the very best of new drum & bass and champion new talent across multiple platforms and territories. As a promoter he’s the co-founder of Soul In Motion, an event brand dedicated to the true underground sound that’s renowned for its midweeklies and unique inner-city locations. As a vibe-obsessed producer, he’s developed a powerful line of releases on Metalheadz, Full Cycle and C.I.A. As a teacher at Point Blank and Middlesex University, he’s fully committed to ensuring the movement is just as strong for the next generation, sharing his knowledge and insights in the same impassioned way he shares the sounds he loves as a DJ.   

Above all, he’s one of the most articulate, incisive, deepest-digging and industry-respected DJs in the game. Foundation-deep roots and reference points and a stash of dubs you’d sell your soul for, his sets are singular experiences that join the dots and weave the genre’s many substyles. It’s why Chase & Status booked him for their RTRN II Jungle launch, why he returns year-on-year to Sun And Bass to curate his own party, why Serato have endorsed him in their Legends series... And why he remains just as in demand, involved and influential as he was when he first became entrenched in the movement.

Born and raised in this beautiful country and now based in London he's the head of Malicious Smile records and Viral Cutz along with his partner Obando. 
In the last years he has created a distinct sound that blends the energy of Techno so perfectly with all the colors of House music. 
His amazing 3 decks DJ set has led him to play in the best clubs from Colombia and featured in some festivals overseas and his productions have always had great support from names like: Dubfire, Richie Hawtin and Marco Carola. 

The very first approach to electronic music was through some 90's dance tapes he used to listen while studying, this was the spark for his idea to create mind stories and make the people dance at the same time. Around 1999 he turned into rock music and learned to play the guitar, he spent about two years playing with his band and recording demos, by that time the electronic scene was growing in his country and he find himself again caught between the beats. 
After becoming a regular raver he achieved a vast collection of records and influences and decided to definitely turn music into his lifestyle, so he learnt to play the turntables and started making his own beats, soon he became a favorite and started playing at mayor events as a warmer for the international artists but the audience pushed him to the main stage.

Actually his sound flows between the best of the Chicago essence and the dark and strong groove of modern techno, leaving no space for complaints.",2743,103,David,David Figueroa,0,10045,user,2020-01-21T21:37:18Z,Figueroa,43,4,figueroa,https://soundcloud.com/figueroa,2,,35,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/10045,soundcloud:users:10045,Figueroa,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:10045,artist-stations:10045,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:10045,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:3039584', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000010045-Opg6Wa-original.jpg'}]",

Time the River blends Reed’s acoustic singer/songwriter chops with the classic California country sound inspired by influences like Neil Young and Tom Petty. The album opens with Reed’s soulful voice on the high energy, toe-tapping tune, “Too Bright to Fade Away.”  The song’s powerful message, especially in the uncertain era of COVID-19, reminds us that we all have “a light too bright to fade away” and that “we’ll keep, we’ll keep on holding on.”
  
Throughout his multi-faceted career, Reed has honed his craft playing thousands of gigs and racking up prestigious awards. For the past five years, the grand prize winner of the Telluride Troubadour contest immersed himself in the Nashville songwriting scene, getting his songs heard by the musical greats and recorded by renowned indie artists. 
 
Reed started his musical journey along the sandy shores of his small, yet idyllic hometown of Destin, Florida. While there, he released two albums – Higher Ground and Piece By Piece. In 2009, seeking inspiration and adventure, Reed moved to Boston. Within months, he captured the Grand Prize of the coveted New York Songwriters Circle and was a winner of The Mountain Stage New Song Competition. During this period of great change, growth and struggle, Reed moved to New York City, found an ally in British producer Iestyn Polson (David Gray, David Bowie) and the two completed the critically acclaimed album, Creatures of the Heart. For his latest release, Time The River, Reed handpicked Nashville-based producer Jesse Thompson, and together they created a musical work of art that is drawn from real life experiences.
 
Reed has opened for or appeared on stage with Hall and Oates, Jason Isbell, Graham Nash, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Shawn Colvin, John Fogerty, The Indigo Girls, Matt Kearney, The All American Rejects, The Punch Brothers, Glen Hansard, Stephen Kellogg & the Sixers, Tim Reynolds (Dave Matthews Band), Shawn Mullins, Jessie Harris, The Whalers and many others.",69,6,Reed,Reed Waddle,0,10050,user,2021-02-04T20:09:56Z,Waddle,1,0,reedwaddle,https://soundcloud.com/reedwaddle,4,,26,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/10050,soundcloud:users:10050,Reed Waddle,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:10050,artist-stations:10050,free,False,False,False,,,,

The Spoonhead experience sends you awash on the dance floor. Futuristic synths soar over ancient tribal rhythms while richly layered textures infuse with the sounds of his homeland Aotearoa. 

Having a solid grasp of progressive-psy whilst writing a diverse range of other genres - deep house, techno, glitch and breaks - Spoonhead flows smoothly between acts of different genres. Spoonhead’s moldable, tweakable live set makes for loads of fun on the dance floor and allows plenty of room for experimentation.

Spoonhead is as much at home in Australia as his homeland New Zealand; having played at Earth Frequency, Cairns Winter Solstice, Collaborations, Psyfari and many more. Be sure to keep an ear out for upcoming music and events by following Spoonhead on the internets.

== BIOGRAPHY ==
Back in the Day, Tyler Smith aka ‘Black Smith Craft’ discovered the unique sound of acid house and was immediately captured by the hypnotic vibe that emanated from the music during the end of the 1980’s.
He found himself seduced & consumed by this wave of electronic music and fell in love with the German melodic trance style labels such as Eye-Q, Platipus and Superstition, as many of us did… 
Having followed dance music in all its forms throughout the 1990’s he started DJ’ing and by the turn of the millennium he started to develop a taste for the more underground techno sound which was coming out of England, Germany & especially the Detroit sound of the time…
Tyler Smith had always wanted to be involved with radio broadcasts and this ambition kicked off in earnest when he started playing regularly on the ‘Tuesday Session’ show, broadcast on the very popular Campus FM (Villeneuve d’Ascq/France), which was run by Dmitri Pike of Mirage/Matrix/Subject Detroit fame.
Spurred on by the development of increased exposure through radio he started honing his skills in music production and the ‘Alphaground’ website was born. This brought about more exposure for his music mission and by 2004 Tyler was performing on a number of key profile dance music stations in France and Holland. During 2006 he launched ‘Interstate 94’ show with Erell Ranson & Pedro Cali for Livesets.com, which was dedicated to the sound of Detroit. This was quickly followed by the aptly named ‘B-Side Show’ which showcased the darker, offbeat & industrial sounds. Currently the main man is managing different shows playing classics from way back, Detroit & Birmingham tunes on Livesets.com, Emergence FM (Limoges/France), and Techno.fm 
In 2006 Tyler’s finally realized the goal of having his debut vinyl release which was in collaboration with Bionic on French label ‘Audiocrash’. This was quickly followed by several upstanding digital releases. Over the years Tyler’s side to the music has become darker & more industrial, which in turn has led to the birth of his most acclaimed project: Black Smith Craft… With music released already on distinct labels from the scene and more on the way for labels including Grovsjopa’s mighty ‘Pohjola’, Leeds finest ‘Limetree’, UTCH rec. & Rednox’ superb free net-label ‘Ante-Rasa’…
Since 2008, Tyler has played across Europe alongside artists like Kr!z, the 65d mavericks, Bas Mooy, DJ Toki, DJ Boss, Bionic, Dimitri Pike, Arrestar, Sean Matters, Systemic, Victor Martinez…
More recently, he has created the groups http://soundcloud.com/groups/technotherapy and http://soundcloud.com/groups/old-school-techno-1 on Soundcloud to keep the real techno spirit alive and promote both established and up and coming techno artists from around the world.",2469,1225,Tyler,Tyler Smith,0,10098,user,2021-12-30T09:11:45Z,Smith,1411,18,tyler-smith,https://soundcloud.com/tyler-smith,0,,14,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/10098,soundcloud:users:10098,Tyler Smith,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:10098,artist-stations:10098,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,soundcloud:users:10098,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:39679', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000010098-oBeKFp-original.jpg'}]",

""It's a way to connect and share with others. Communication is crucial. Just being able to do what I do, to write and sing and perform, makes me feel not only alive, but incredibly lucky. Knowing at any moment everything could change, I don't take one second for granted.""

“Allison sings with such an intensity of emotion, it's easy to see why she's often quoted as saying 'Why music? Why breathing?',” notes culture blog Muruch. “That kind of artistic passion seems extremely rare these days.""

Crowe's home is Corner Brook, NL. Her birthplace is Nanaimo, BC (November 16, 1981). From Canada's coasts she's taken the road less-traveled to harmonizing life as musician (voice, piano, guitar, fiddle, bodhran), composer, arranger, audio engineer & producer. From the lovely isle of Newfoundland her reach is global.

Ani DiFranco and Loreena McKennitt inspired the strong-willed Scorpio to create Rubenesque Records, her own label. Since 2001, via 26 albums, singles, EPs and compilations, Crowe's oeuvre nears 200 unique tracks embracing roots, rock, Celtic, folk, jazz, soul, Canadiana and Broadway.

Rubenesque's series of artistically and commercially successful releases includes: Lisa's Song+ 6 Songs (2001-3); Tidings (2003/4); Secrets (2004); Live at Wood Hall (2005); This Little Bird (2006); Little Light (2008); Spiral (2010); Arthur / Up to the Mountain (2011); Tidings Concert (2012); Newfoundland Vinyl (2013); Heavy Graces (2013); Songbook (2013/14); Souling (2014); Newfoundland Vinyl II (2014); Sylvan Hour (2015); Newfoundland Vinyl 3 (2015); Souling (Bonus Tracks Edition) (2015); and Introducing / Heirs + Grievances (2016).

Broadcast highlights include a pair of one-hour television specials: “Allison Crowe: Inside Pandora’s Box” and “Tidings” (airing, for years, nationally across Canada).

Crowe performs solo and with band – LIN (cello, vocals), Sarah White (mandolin, guitar, vocals), Dave Baird (bass, vocals) – headlining concerts on hundreds of occasions in over a dozen countries.

Billed before Carol Ann Duffy, Britain’s Poet Laureate, and (the late) Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Master of the Queen's Music, ""Canadian angel Allison Crowe gave one of the weekend's most magical moments,"" relates The Scotsman. 

In 2012, Allison Crowe thrilled with Canada's Royal Winnipeg Ballet singing and playing live-on-stage with dancers for ""The Doorway – Scenes from Leonard Cohen"".

Hollywood director Zack Snyder flew Crowe cross-continent to cameo in ""Man of Steel"" – covering ""Ring of Fire"" on-screen in 2013's Superman blockbuster. “I’m a big Johnny Cash fan. And I’m a big Allison Crowe fan,"" reveals Snyder (Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen, Sucker Punch). ""So the combination to me seemed like an awesome opportunity if we could make it happen.”

Crowe is Musical Director of ""Newfoundland Vinyl"" – a rollicking hit at the Gros Morne Theatre Festival each Summer (since 2012). Theatre Newfoundland and Labrador Artistic Director Jeff Pitcher, (who conceived the show), remarks: ""No matter where she is in this world, that voice, that conviction, it crosses all borders.""

""The first thing you notice about Allison Crowe is her voice. Rich and dark, it seems to come from a place most singers can only dream of accessing. Then there are the songs. Filled with raw passion and accompanied by Crowe's eloquent piano playing."" Clodagh O'Connell (The Courier, Rolling Stone+) posits: ""Elton John meets Edith Piaf"".

""Soulful. Alive. Joyous. Grievous. Real, true, music is what I want to make,"" says Allison Crowe.

  Under various guises I started DJ'ing Hardcore around '91-'92, before moving on to Jungle and D&B before a short-lived foray into US Garage, all of which I spun on various London-based Pirate Radio stations.
  
  During this time I had been producing D&B until in 1999 I sold all my Hardware to travel around the US.
  
  I ventured into more guitar based live music during the early 00's before rediscovering my love for Electronic Dance Music and falling for the sound of Dubstep, and a scene which reminds me so much of the early days of D&B.
  
  I attained a diploma in Audio Engineering in 2005 after 2 years study, and here I am now, producing using Reason V4 and other DAW's, and a mixture of Hardware I have gathered up over the years.

TKDE started off as an audiovisual project back in 2000, influenced by old silent movie directors such as Murnau and Lang, but also the animations of Jan Svankmeijer or the films of the Quay Brothers. Jason Köhnen and Gideon Kiers, started creating soundtracks to old silent movies (Nosferatu, Metropolis) and progressively composed new music inspired by these images which eventually became TKDE. Trombone player Hilary Jeffery (originally from the UK, residing in Amsterdam) joined in 2004 and introduced Swiss born Nina Hitz. The debut album 'The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble' was recorded with this line up, and was released on UK electronica label Planet Mu early 2006. TKDE expanded to six when Eelco Bosman and French vocalist Charlotte Cegarra joined the ensemble in 2007. The second album is soon to be released !

Bachelier en Arts Visuels, la création d’un son unique et propre à lui, lui semblait primordial. Il adore faire les les choses autrement et cela lui permet de sortir des sentiers battus.

Son parcours musical débute assis derrière un drum, une trompette ou un saxophone. C’est une fois déménagé à Montréal qu’il doit trouver le moyen de faire du bruit sans déranger la ville au grand complet. Il se met donc à la production de musique électronique. Il produit 8 albums entre 2002 et 2008. Aujourd’hui il vit principalement de son travail d’artiste peintre (patcanin.com) mais consacre une bonne partie de son temps à mixer dans les clubs et quelques événements extérieurs.

Son “son” est groovy et se danse extrêmement bien. Il a une préférence marquée pour le “dark techno” mais aime bien mixer du minimal drôle et happy.

Ses influences principales se situent entre My Oizo, Mistress Barbara, Vitaminsforyou, Richie Hawtin, Dan Bell, et Tool

Born in 1978, Le Cantin has always been interested in electronic music and sound.
With a Bachelor’s degree in fine arts he has always been one to look for new and unique sounds which set him apart from the rest of the crowd.

He began producing during the year 2000 and was not a DJ prior to when he began producing. Today he’s living from his art (patcantin.com) but most of his free time is dedicated to Djing. Mixing Dark Techno is what he digs the most but loves to play some edgy minimal funny tracks as well.
His sound is refreshingly crisp, clean and groovy with the influence from many artists inluding Mr. Oizo, Mistress Barbara, Vitaminsforyou, Richie Hawtin, Dan Bell, and Tool.",601,273,Le,Le Cantin,0,10159,user,2022-01-19T23:55:01Z,Cantin,129,4,lecantin,https://soundcloud.com/lecantin,4,,2,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/10159,soundcloud:users:10159,lecantin,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:10159,artist-stations:10159,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:10159,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:22265841', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000010159-KBzrEs-original.jpg'}]",

Invincible has enjoyed working with Tony Bowes the founder of Modern Urban Jazz over the last few years, and have produced numerous tracks which have been received well across the board. Visit http://www.modernurbanjazz.com for details on the label, releases and it's artists.

Invincible's work has been heard numerous times on BBC Radio 1Xtra as played by DJ Flight. 'Future Sound' by Justice &amp; Invincible was tailored to suit DJ Flight and used as a 'set starter' on numerous occasions in England and Europe. 

Invincible's work has been aired on many radio stations over the years, and has created tailored adverts for many different radio stations.

And the trio has also received radio support on an international scale with Proton Radio, America, & Techno FM, Canada, Frisky Radio UK & their own radio show on Vega Radio (featured in central & south America - Dirty Rhythm Sessions.....) giving airtime to our guys. 
Whilst early productions from Dirty Rhythm Syndicate were released on their own digital label, R-Type Recordings, their distinct techy-progressive sound has led to collaborations with EDM labels Baroque, Pure Substance, System Recordings, Polytechnic Recordings, Convert recordings, DeepSound Music, Proton Records, Twisted Beats, System Recordings, Red Robot Records & AudioBite Records. The quality of their tracks has also resulted in remix success for the likes of Hernan Serrao, Disciples of Sound & Stevie Vega.
Plus the guys own reputation for quality remixing led them to reworking ‘Justify’ by house music legend Morgan King, featuring the awesome vocal talent of Charma, which in turn led to their big 2011 remix of grammy-nominated track ‘I’m Free’ - both released by King’s imprint label, Accidental Music, and both receiving massive support. And the remixes don’t end there… Dirty Rhythm Syndicate has had multiple releases through DeepSound Music & Red Robot Records, plus labels M.O.D.E music, MC//Groove Records, Trance All-Stars Records, Low Pressings, Un-Virtual Music, Orbiter Music & Underphunk Recordings. 
So where did the rhythm all begin? … Hailing from four generations of classically trained musicians, music was an inevitable part of Jay’s life (also now one half of trance duo, re:hab/Ego Punks with Stevie Vega). For Neil, his feel for music came from a well-struck pair of drumsticks as a youngster. And with the 90s came the craze & the draw of the dance scene, and for both Jay & Neil a very keen ear for dj’ing. Between them these guys have enjoyed residencies & played guest slots at some of the UK’s finest clubs…. Ministry of Sound (Rulin), Miss Moneypennys, Turnmills, S.L.A.G, Glasshouse & The Complex. They’ve even supported UK Ska band ‘Bad Manners’ and can add Holland, Greece & Spain to their international dj resumés.

And the missing piece… Gary. An accomplished musician (plus member of band The Secret Screens)… his mainstays guitar & keyboard, with 21 years of experience in the music industry including touring & playing New York, Paris & Ibiza. Gary adds master engineer & producer to his list of skills with production releases on albums through house music legends Renaissance & Global Underground.

Signed to Groovenight Management, headed up by Hernan Serrao, and with quality 2012 track & remix releases, the future for Dirty Rhythm Syndicate is looking more techy ‘progressive’ than ever. Watch this space…

He’s an electronic music veteran who’s been performing since 1997, recognized internationally as a tastemaker and energetic innovator with over 100 mixes to his name. He performs live with Ableton and APC40 – cutting and layering loops at lightning speed, blurring the line between a live and DJ’d set. His signature “future bass” sound is filled with tricked-out drums, head-nodding beats, heavy bass, and full spectrum synths that tug at your heartstrings. His style hits the sweet spot between dance floor madness and headphone listening. As a world-renown music journalist and performing DJ, he’s on a mission to expose international listeners to fresh new sounds from rising artists.

Drawing sonic connections and blending styles is part of the Kid’s DNA – that’s why “Kameleon” fits him perfectly. His current sound is a mixture of glitched-out and cutup instrumental hip-hop, slow/fast drum and bass, intricate post-dubstep, global beats like digital kudoro, footwork, trap, dub, and even the broken end of garage and techno. He’s always on the lookout for tunes from unexpected places – like “Pixelhouse” from the far corners of Japan, club tracks from Africa or “VHSwave” from the heartland of America. A sense of humor and theatrical spirit are big parts his live shows – they give him a unique ability to connect to his fans. Kid Kameleon is a reminder to the universe that no one can connect to a dance-floor crowd like a great DJ.

A born traveler who's been touring internationally since 2002, he first planted roots in ‘90s New York City warehouse culture with DJ Spooky and the Soundlab crew. Together they explored a fusion of underground hip-hop, jungle, techno and dancehall. Next he spent 9 years contributing to the vibrant San Francisco scene, throwing genre-bending events of future beats, downtempo, dubstep and global bass with his crews Surya Dub, False Profit, and The Den SF. In total he’s played in over 25 countries and with 1000s of artists – a tiny slice include Mala, Porier, Starkey, Richie Divine, Dizzee Rascal, Squarepusher, Machinedrum, Kode9, Pole, Bassnectar, The Glitch Mob, Tycho, Flako, Robot Koch and even Coxon Dodd.

Kid Kameleon’s mixes have been going “viral” since before YouTube existed. People still point to 2004’s Absolutely Shocking and Even More Shocking as an important moment in eclectic bass music culture, on par with mixes by Coldcut, dj/rupture and The Gaslamp Killer. Featured on Kid606’s Shockout label, they were praised by influential music writer Simon Reynolds, who went on to interview the Kid about technology in DJ culture for his seminal book Energy Flash. Career highlights include the 2nd ever XLR8R Podcast, a unique mix of “discarded loops” for Electronic Explorations (Rob Booth lists Kid Kameleon as a major influence), a guest spot for Tom Ravenscroft on the BBC, the raucous Must Love Loops on Cock Rock Disco, and dozens of others for Percussion Lab, Mashit, Modyfier, Spannered, Dublab, Memekast and more. Kid Kameleon has also been a music journalist for the past decade, writing under his given name Matt Earp. Often “calling” groundbreaking performers years before they become international stars, he’s interviewed 100s of artists including The Bug, James Blake, Flying Lotus and Mary Anne Hobbs. He spent 6 years as a staff writer at XLR8R in the 2nd half of the ‘00s and wrote the world’s first column dedicated to bass music (‘Basic Needs’). He currently writes for Create Digital Music and Vice’s Thump.

Kid Kameleon moved to Berlin in 2013 to further explore his “future bass” sound and connect with boundary-pushing artists and shows in Europe. After 3 years, he returned to Oakland in the Spring of 2016.",3438,957,Matt,Matt Earp,0,10225,user,2022-02-09T15:56:38Z,Earp,122,5,kidkameleon,https://soundcloud.com/kidkameleon,0,,17,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/10225,soundcloud:users:10225,Kid Kameleon,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:10225,artist-stations:10225,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,soundcloud:users:10225,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:1754104', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000010225-QsxFvM-original.jpg'}]",

When it comes to direction, Bleak is somebody to count on.
His productions are underpinned by a fat bass construction, evolving dark and surrealistic pads, chords and heavy rhythms. Giving away tremendous spaces of reverb and complicated structures in his music, pretty much inspired in the underground Techno and House styles of the 90´s.
Releases on Deeply Rooted House soon led to the Origins of Chaos EP on Delsin, which saw him establish himself as one of the new generation of techno producers to watch. Able to bring it as a DJ, making his debut at Berghain – Berlin early in 2014, it is his fully analogue LIVE set that has set pulses racing throughout Europe and beyond. Constantly being refined the combination of powerful rhythms and a surgical sense of timing set it apart and makes for a genuinely live experience. Fabric – London, Space – Ibiza, Harry Klein – Munich have so far felt the full force.
When creating drive as well as Bleak does, not much can be said more clearly than his music itself. By simply putting everything into his tracks, Bleak goes deep into a state where nostalgia, the present and the future dwells, a place and atmosphere being well communicated through his personal style of Techno.",9521,708,,,0,10242,user,2021-03-11T02:32:00Z,,53,3,bleak-msq,https://soundcloud.com/bleak-msq,11,,3,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/10242,soundcloud:users:10242,Bleak (Delsin/DRH/Naura),False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:10242,artist-stations:10242,free,False,False,False,soundcloud:users:10242,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:129211389', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000010242-f06SkZ-original.jpg'}]",

The cultural mixture in the world of music and the different faces immerse the production of the projects makes Jay Jay Amaro a non conventional musician and places him far of the most known producers.

Spanning all genres of club music, his signature sound captures the essence of the culturally vibrant New York club scene, distinguishing him as a quintessential DJ, and visionary producer/musician. Developing an impeccable reputation internationally with some of biggest names in the industry, his productions have had more aliases than Smith and Jones, … Station Q, Bass Hit, The Element, Swing 52, New Hippie Movement, and Central Park. But whatever the name, Candelario’s fans can always tell who’s behind that trademark beat chugging, bass line driven, anthem praising, dance floor dominating sound that has been acclaimed timeless by many of his peers.

His latest venture Transitori Music, an extension of his production company 2nd color Entertainment, is Candelario’s own digital imprint. His mission is to release forward-thinking music from a diverse roster of up and coming artist. Rather than concentrating on a specific style, Candelario aims to have a platform where he can truly express creative freedom through a varied selection of music. So far it has proven true, having licensed several of his past releases to the likes of Ministry of Sound and several other European and Japanese labels.

Though his many productions have been praised around the world, Benji is always quick to point out his roots. He is a DJ foremost that produces records and not a producer that now DJs. He is in his element playing the hottest clubs (from the dark, underground spots to the big rooms) in Ibiza, Greece, UK, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Canada and the U.S.

Without compromising his expansive knowledge and exquisite taste, his style remains fun and accessible. When Benji plays he takes care to bring his listeners with him on his musical journey and makes sure they stay with him the whole party through. It has always been important to him that people understand and enjoy his unique musical point of view, making him a favorite with promoters and club goers alike.",2229,29,Benji ,Benji  Candelario,0,10259,user,2022-01-30T05:00:01Z,Candelario,7,0,benjicandelario,https://soundcloud.com/benjicandelario,26,,120,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/10259,soundcloud:users:10259,BenjiCandelario,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:10259,artist-stations:10259,creator-pro-unlimited,False,True,False,soundcloud:users:10259,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:978461', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000010259-XH01Og-original.jpg'}]",

Fascinated by early 2000 Anthony Rother's productions, I started doin' some tracks (you can download them on soundcloud) and playing around where possible.
What I like best is producing and creating new sounds and rhytms and I'm starting to enjoy playing live too since I can play some of my own original tracks.
The name Digitalica was choosen cause I make music only with digital support (PC and midi controllers) and I liked to let everybody know i come from Italy, my loved country and as a tribute for Italo Disco too

I've dabbled in producing progressive house for years now, surfacing every so often to produce a few tracks then taking a break again.  I got my start like so many others out there, I just picked up a bit of gear one day and started writing music.  At the time I didn't know what these blurps and worbbles I was making in my headphones were but eventually I decided that it was some sort of electronic music.  So in response to that I went out and learned how to DJ in an attempt to find my sound.  After many late nights and countless after-parties, I finally settled on progressive house and I haven't really turned back.  Sounds have changed, my studio has grown and the quality of the music today far surpasses what the gear was capable of 10 years ago, but one thing has remained constant in all of this and that is the feeling I get every time a really sick bassline drops over some brilliantly programmed percussion.  I still aspire to that feeling and look for it in every track that I start.

Nina Simone once said ""An artist's duty, as far as am concerned, is to reflect the times."" And that is what Tshila was aiming for with her upcoming album ""World In Crisis."" She is not shy about addressing the Political situation and challenges we face especially from an African Woman's perspective. The album also contains personal material that reflects Personal Crisis as well. After all, what is the world but what we personally perceive? The tone of the music is however, upbeat, with moments of melancholy and self-reflection, to take you on a journey through a World In Crisis, according to Tshila.

Since its inception, Marine Parade's vision was to push sounds that not only rock nightclubs, but also have the musical depth to move beyond the dance floor. Indeed, Marine Parade has released some of electronic music’s most enduring albums, like Freeland’s  Now&Them, Evil Nine’s You Can Be Special Too, and ILS’ Soul Trader, and continues to innovate on the DJ mix CD format.

After Jetstream disbanded, Zolton moved to New York where he gave music away and focused on a new career running a digital media company. During that time, he launched the music and culture website, Lost At E Minor, which was a vehicle through which to promote and encourage the talent of some Australia’s hottest emerging creatives.

At the end of 2016, Zolton moved back to Sydney and was re-invigorated to get back into creating music again.

Founded in 2004 in Ann Arbor, Michigan by Jakub Alexander and Adam E. Hunt, the label began as an effort to popularize the founders’ opinion that electronic music is a process, not a genre; within its walls live a diverse range of sounds, which would be documented over the course of the label’s development.
The label is currently based in Brooklyn, New York, with Jakub and Adam sharing label management duties. Jakub handles A+R and Adam serves as the mastering engineer and web designer. Design and artwork is provided by Alex Koplin, who joined the label in 2008. Design contributors include: PhilistineDSGN, Adam E.

Djs Pareja are Mariano Caloso and Diego Irasusta, a Buenos Aires-based duo of djs and producers who have played in the most important clubs and festivals in Argentina and all over the world since 2000, taken their personal and eclectic style wherever they go. Core members of the amazing Cómeme record label run by Matias Aguayo, the duo have been integral in defining the new-school of techno made in South America.

They have toured Europe three times, Mexico four times and the USA, Canada and Australia. They are the Argentinean djs with the most international growth in the last years by the hand of Cómeme and Turbo. They have been resident djs of the legendary Compass parties at Niceto Club Bs.As. and now-a-days they throw their own parties, Fun Fun and Leftclub in the city capital.

They have done remixes for Little Dragon, Justin Robertson, Rodion, Alejandro Paz, Steve Lawler, Gui Boratto and Matias Aguayo to name a few. Apart from their productions for Cómeme, they have also released EP’s on Tiga’s Turbo Recordings as well as on Huntleys & Palmers, Honey Soundsystem Records and Schalen.

The deal lead to the release of the Got The Funk Ep in 2005, which included a remix from Madox and was a massive hit, with support from all major players across the board. The remix also received a nomination for best remix at Breakspoll 2006, and was included in the Beatz and Bobz compilation mixed by Jds. The single was followed by the Back Home Ep on Mantra Breaks, again one of the most prominent breakbeat labels in the world, voted best label at Breakspoll 2007. After these two releases Plaza started working on a string of remixes all through 2006 and 2007, re-tweaking Dj Killer on Functional, Flore on IbreaksFunk, The Drum Monkeys on Westway, MI Loki on Tricksta, and doing a split remix Ep with the Groove Diggerz for Ape records. His remix of The Drum Monkeys’ Batty Batucada made even Fatboy Slim take notice, so much that he called Westway personally to get his hands on a copy of the vinyl! While his remix of Dj Killer’s Acid – released on Functional – has recently been included by General Midi on the latest instalment of the much respected Y4K series on Distinctive. Even with all this remix activity, Plaza has still found time to come up with some original tunes, releasing Get On Down on West records in early 2007. Press support has been high, with the new West single and the Flore remix being given the 5-star treatment in I-dj mag, the Got The Funk and Back Home Ep’s both voted sureplayers in Dj Mag, and the Drum Monkeys remix being chosen as dancefloor destroyer in the aforementioned Dj Mag. Djing has also picked up hugely between 2006 and 2007, and has seen Plaza performing at Breakspoll at Fabric in February, playing two of the Uk’s biggest festivals – namely Glastonbury and Glade – while also jetting around to play in the States, France, Italy, Spain and some of the most respected clubnights in the Uk. There have been a lot more releases between the second half of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, namely the remix of Zimbardo ""Say Hey"" on Ruff Dog, the remix of Break The Box ""Groovy Moves"" on Ground Level, the remix of the Beat Assassins ""Generation MTV"" on Mofo and a new original, ""Ghetto Groove/Beatdown"" on Brighton Breaks. In February 2008, Plaza De Funk was invited to play Breakspoll for the second time in a row and was nominated in two categories - best breakthrough dj and best breakthrough producer. He won the award for Best Breakthrough Dj and is currently busy gigging throughout the world.
Highlights of 2009 so far include another performance at Breakspoll, 2 tours in the States and the first tour of Australia. Add to this the fact that Do It - a tune that was originally written for a charity complitation project - has just been selected by the Plump Dj's for inclusion in their massive new Global Underground mix cd, and you'll see why the future looks bright!",2397,546,Plaza De Funk,Plaza De Funk,0,10445,user,2019-07-11T10:11:46Z,,6,0,plazadefunk,https://soundcloud.com/plazadefunk,2,,8,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/10445,soundcloud:users:10445,plazadefunk,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:10445,artist-stations:10445,free,False,False,False,,,,

+++ Bio +++
A passionate vinyl and cassette collector of any kind of music with soul in its foundation. Qwanah has dj’ed at a vast number of underground clubs, night clubs, radio stations and bars around Stockholm, London and New York the past 20 years.

Qwanah grew up in between Stockholm, California and Arizona. All though heavily influenced by the 90’s hip hop & rnb era, he was first schooled musically by his Mother. Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, Four Tops, Sly & The Family Stone, Jimi Hendrix, WAR, Doobie Brothers, Santana, Led Zeppelin, Michael Jackson, Prince among others was played regularly at home.

In his preteen years he discovered hip hop via his older brother and says it changed his life. In high school he would dub cassette tapes and make his own mixtapes and give them out to friends. That's when Qwanah really started to experiment mixing songs together and make concept tapes that eventually lead him to buying a pair of turntables and a dj mixer. The rest is history.

In his early 20's Qwanah moved to London to pursue his dream as a dj/producer. He studied music production at SAE and on the weekends he would dj and occasionally sell sneakers to finance his living.

In 2012 Qwanah moved to New York and says he re-discovered hip hop all over again - ""Meeting Kool Herc was like meeting my second father"". New York City had a tremendous impact on Qwanah musically. He says the city breathes hip hop, salsa and jazz. It's during this time Qwanah started to dig deeper into the latin grooves, dub, reggae and roots sections.

Qwanah claims to be an eclectic record selector rather than a technical dj pushing buttons. His sets are widely known to incorporate dance music of all sorts whether it be deep house, broken beat, breakbeat hardcore, UKG, 90 dnb, tekno, hip hop, cumbia, salsa, dub or reggae – it will make you feel good. He runs a club called 'Coco’s Special Order' (also a record label) a genre free club playing dance music. Qwanah has also partly been running the club ’Raw Fusion’ together with Mad Mats and Tooli.",104,236,Boo,Boo Comanche,0,10455,user,2021-04-13T15:26:57Z,Comanche,274,11,qwanah,https://soundcloud.com/qwanah,0,,5,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/10455,soundcloud:users:10455,Qwanah,False,,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:10455,artist-stations:10455,creator-pro,True,False,False,soundcloud:users:10455,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:38141566', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000010455-G0zA0w-original.jpg'}]",

""Emanuel Vinson is the sort of absurdly ambitious young musician whose burning desire to express himself in as many ways as possible is bound to warm the heart of the most jaded listener. He takes part in poetry slams at his Chicago high school, he plays drums in a post-rock band and, at the ripe age of 17, he's just made his first solo album, ""Etape Un! (My Me, Your Me),"" available as a free download off a link on his Web site (www.myspace.com/emanuelvinson).

If the electro-hip-hop, industrial-electronica backings sometimes sound a bit canned -- Vinson crafted the album using Ableton, an audio sequencer playable in real time like an instrument -- his sung/rapped/recited lyrics/tone poems contain bursts of humor, inspiration and poignancy, along with touches of high-school sophomore silliness (perfectly understandable, since he actually was a high school sophomore not that long ago). ""It was a creative laxative of sorts,"" Vinson says of these sounds, and that's no b.s.""

His first and main musical influences started to notice at an early age, a period in which his father managed a record shop in Seville, his home city, and he came into contact with 60s and 70s funk, soul and rock records. In 1996 begins his intense and unstoppable contact with electronic music.

Musical production became so important in his career that in November, 2005 takes place the opening ceremony of his new project www.flumo.com, a project that focuses on both free access Advanced Electronic Music and other avant-garde artistic contents.

V.Rotz has played with artists such as Pascal F.e.o.s, Smash TV, Kiki, Apparat, Glimpse, Konrad Black, Vincenzo, Dave Dk, 3Channels or Barem, among others.His music has been played in places like Granada, Córdoba, Málaga, Valencia, Palma de Mallorca, Menorca, Barcelona, Portugal and,of course, Seville,his home city.

Besides his side as Dj and producer, nowadays he develops his Live Act, which was performed for the first time in August 2006 in Seville together with Barem (M_nus) in Emporio Club. Since then he has played it in all the clubs in Seville, as well as in other cities in Spain like Fellini or City Hall (Barcelona),Mogambo (Valencia), Tittos, BCM (Mallorca), Sasinia (Menorca), Colonial (Marbella), Industrial Copera (Granada), Zoom Club (Lloret de Mar,Girona), La_Sala (Ceuta), Gabinete Literario (Las Palmas, Gran Canarias...He has also presented his live act in festivals like Lux in Seville, Netaudio Festival in Barcelona or Electrosplash in Valencia.
 When 

V.Rotz´s career as producer started, it was almost during two whole weeks in Beatport top ten, with his minimal techhouse track called Mirto,signed in the disappeared American label Subtropical Records. 

As Flumo founder and coowner, he has also founded Flumo Netlabel, Fluidos Netlabel and Flumo Recordings, all of them having the support of both critics and public.

As V.Rotz, he has signed works for Flumo Recordings, Nordik Label, Neovinyl Recordings, Subconce Digital and Sweet Leaf Recordings.
In 2009 he starts a new project called TWICE with his mate and friend Photoclick aka Antikom.They perform for the first time in Flumo Recordings 005 and, immediately after that, they sign ""Back to Basic"", reference 009 of the catalog of this label,counting with an amazing response of the most important artists of the planet,like Angel Molina, Stacey Pullen, Laurent Garnier, Dj Hell, Deetron or Steve Bug,among many others. After this success,labels like Nordik Net, Diaphan, Fiakun Label, Raw Cutz Records or Losin Sucki (Hypercolour Sublabel ) begin to demand their works.

The intention was to become the "" GUY "" behind the mixing console. -Not knowing quite sure what that ""GUY"" was supposed to do.-

Living and studying in NYC when you're young can offer a lot in terms of Artistic knowledge.

That's when he meets Fresh Nunas. A fellow African/Mozambican brother with whom he quickly identifies and link up.

Since 1997 he has been working on his musical career with an immovable commitment – behind the decks as well as a producer and a radio and tour host. Everything started with a residency at legendary Fusion Club in Münster (Germany). Bob constantly redefined his own sound – fascinated and inspired by the variety of electronic music. In his sets he skillfully combines the best from various genres. With the right feeling for the sound which represents him he is booked all over Germany and internationally. His was billed for clubs and festivals like WMC in Miama, Nature One, Ruhr in Love, Suicide Circus (Berlin), Studio (Essen), Hotel Shanghai (Essen), Butan (Wuppertal) and many more. Through his collaboration with Spedro many EPs and remixes came up on notable labels like Supdub, Elevation Ltd, Momentum and Cimelde. Bob’s Spaced Out EP, released on Broombeck’s label Yes We Can in November 2014, is also available on vinyl and received a huge amount of positive feedback. The result of a successful cooperation with John Lagora is the label Seoul Community. The imprint can look back at an impressive catalogue of artists like Kolombo, Kevin Over, MSMS, Spedro, Kasbah Zoo and Yooj.

Viva la Electronic is Bob’s second passion. This radio show broadcasted weekly hosts sets and label specials from Moon Harbour, Upon You, Avotre and Mindshake amongst others. The worldwide recognised radio show is broadcasted on more than 20 global channels. Viva la Electronica Magazine and Viva la Electronica Club Tour are also part of the project. International tour stops in the whole of Europe and South America testify the respectable range of the brand. Since 2013 Bob has been the host and resident of a series of parties called Frohnatur in Essen (Germany), where he also runs Viva la Electronica Techno Edition parties.

Bob Morane's caliber is impressive. He ensured himself a place in the first rows thanks to his quality and profundity. Either on the dance floor, in the radio or in his productions – Bob’s absolute commitment to House and Techno is currently noticeable in everything he does.

Never willing to settle for anything average, Lewis designs all the artwork for his labels music and injects that same passion into his extraordinary DJ sets, productions and remixes.

After putting on parties for years, Lewis established Hindsight as a regular night at Inigo Bar London with Javier Espanol. The events grew from strength to strength and together they filled the place with guests including King Roc, Audiojack and Justin Robertson, to name just a few. With a fast growing reputation Lewis was soon hosting Hindsight parties with James Talk in the main room at The Cross and Anil Chawla, Miniminds and Neil Quigley at Egg. In 2007 Lewis’s explosive ‘Rock Out Of Bed EP’ and a mix CD circulated London’s clubs reaching the ears of Raymundo Rodriguez leading to regular sessions at Jaded, at AKA/The End and a feature on his Ministry of Sound radio show. Meantime, ClubClass in Maidstone invited him to play their Christmas party alongside Nic Fanciulli and Osamu M, leading to Osamu signing and releasing ‘Rock Out Of Bed’ in March 2008 on Outerspace Records. 

Lewis is also no stranger to radio with guest mixes on Raymundo Rodriguez’s Ministry of Sound Radio show, ALiVE with Tom Budden on Proton Radio and Electrobit with FLSK on exa fm (Mexico).

Creative passion and ambition led Lewis to establish his own label, Bigger Deer Recordings in early 2008, where he could explore and expand on his unique musical style. The first release, ‘Empty Draw’ received top reviews from James Zabiela, Dylan Rhymes, Funk D’Void and Andrew Grant. His follow up ‘Techno Birds’, featuring Anil Chawla and Maher Daniel on remix duties was featured on John Digweed’s Transitions Radio show. Since then, Lewis has enjoyed production support from Desyn Masielo, Alex Tepper, Eddie Richards, Nic Fanciulli, Hernan Cattaneo, Laurent Garnier and many many more on numerous projects. He’s also fast establishing himself as a remix supremo having remixed Trisco – ‘Hoopla’ for Whoop! Digital, FLSK – ‘Evolving I’ for We Are Here and Miguel Rendeiro – ‘Quartz’ for OKO. Lewis also has a queue of thumping releases of his own due out this summer with his ‘Regional Gangster EP’ coming on Randall Jones’s Mynt Music, ‘Poo On My Shoe EP’ on Kanio’s Novakane label and ‘Spit In The Gold Fish Bowl EP’ on Alecs Martas Cuartro Records.

In autumn 2008 Lewis was crowned winner of the Pioneer/Space Ibiza DJ residency competition, and things have just been manic since then with gigs spanning the globe and all spare time spent on productions, developing and twisting his style.

Lewis’s latest release ‘Passport Ready’ on Bigger Deer Recordings has attracted the attention of none other than Carl Cox, who just loves Lewis’s “sexy underground hypnotic house music”. With all this in the bag and a bunch of hot summer ’09 releases in the pipe, it’s hard to comprehend that Lewis is still just 23 years old!

Later on to drums and 15 minutes of inde-rock fame.  Soon came DJing every college weekend, and the Twilo late 90's/early 2000's.  A few parties series, residencies, and an IT consulting career later, following frustration with NYC Dave moved to Berlin in 2003.

Berlin has been good.  Working as an assistant engineer at Polytrash studios, product specialist at Native Instruments, founded the M party series which ran through the best of Berlin clubs including WMF, Watergate, and Weekend, in addition to DJ touring and original music production Dave got into as much as he could. It was his mission to give to Berlin as much as he took.

Together with long time collaborator John Selway Dave runs CSM records since 2005. Later co-founding the PullProxy agency and InterPull label, the Berlin years were intense.

The future will see new releases from both labels, new collaborations and new flavas.
