―

Elektropusher took his first steps in the electronic music scene at a rather young age, producing his very first works for italian iconic record label IRMA. After the debut with “E-Teaching” and some quality follow ups ""Sweetie Pumpkin"" and ""Yellowphants"", he hit with successful and acclaimed productions on Hervé's record label Cheap Thrills, home of amazing acts that have changed dance music in the last years, with ""18%"" and ""Mood Gorning"", and on highly estimated finnish Top Billin with ""Bicycles"".

His tracks have been played and supported by some of the greatest names on the scene such as Benny Benassi, Fake Blood, Crookers, Duke Dumont, Afrojack, Congorock, Moguai, Jacques Lu Cont, Annie Nightingale, Spank Rock to name a few. He has done official remixes for the likes of Hervé, The Subs, Malente, Tommie Sunshine, Kissy Sell Out, Lee Mortimer, Larry Tee, being released on labels such as Ultra, Lektroluv and Wearhouse. 

Aired by some of the major networks around the world ― BBC Radio 1, Indie 103.1, Triple J and more ― his tracks have also impressed the most important reviewers from Mixmag to DJ Mag and so on.

""If Congorock was produced by Mr. Oizo it would only sound half as good as this production"" (Dj Mag)

""A guy we will be hearing loads of in the future"" (Tillate Mag)

Details: Noun
An individual feature, fact, or item.

A Thousand Details is Gustavo Lima, owner of Reaktivate Records. Once half of Quantic Spectroscopy, A Thousand Details seeks self-expression and experimentation in controlled realms of Electronic Music. Inspired by a long time of hearing and admiring many genres of music like Industrial, Metal and early day Techno and House, Gustavo’s goal is to build his mental images in organized temporal sounds.

The main idea is to not be defined by a meaningless and shorten genre in a so vast Universe. Sonic explorations without limiting it to a place and a period of time. Every moment, every sight, sound is a motif of inspiration to create new realms. The only words describing it might be hypnotic, dark, somber and unknown. The rest is music for everyone who wants to embrace it.

Known for playing many genres in his DJ Sets, A Thousand Details has many years on the craft and been around his own country, Portugal, spreading his feelings with powerful and emotional sets that captivate the attention of the public. Like a snake charmer, he feels the urge to hypnotize and charm the crowds into travelling paths out of our reality and build memories of great moments in unknown territories. In 2016 he started his radio show “Corridors” on UK Seance Radio to show how he builds those corridors into different universes.

As a producer his first appearance was on Reaktivate 2nd Vinyl release with Portuguese experimental duo Sturqen. Following the success of the release and the hard work he puts in everything he crafts many other opportunities came to release on labels like Dynamic Refleciton, Faut Section, Circular Limited, Illegal Alien, Shaded Explorations, Trabet, Seance, Wunderblock, ARTS, Translucent, Konstrukitv and other fine labels. In 2015 after releasing on Lewis Fautzi, Faut Section, he got invited to play his hardware live act at NeoPop Festival in Portugal in one of the country biggest electronic music events. His hard work is what he believes in to allow him to transmit emotions and memories by his music.

Gustavo also has different alter egos like Curse Records H8R and Wretched Records Marcel Mrak, where he tries different approaches to techniques and views and perhaps not so controlled ambients, but pure chaos.

Is Skitchy a reclusive, manic depressive, obsessive-compulsive, long-haired Cornish weirdo? 
Yes. 
Is it true that he rarely leaves the house, refuses to do interviews, and builds his own computers and synthesizers?
Certainly.
But as one reviewer stated, reflected in the work coming from the studio of this tormented computer geek you will find ""Genius-come-borderline-insanity"".

Skitchy aka James Martin is a writer-producer of electronic/pop/rock music ranging from Hip-Hop right through the tempo spectrum to Drum&Bass. Working alone from a small studio in Cornwall in the UK, Skitchy has managed to successfully infiltrate the music Industry: 

""Bomba Ding is one of the catchiest tunes we've heard yet on One Music and it's courtesy of Skitchy aka drum'n'bass/electronica ace James Martin..."" - Huw Stephens, BBC Radio 1.

James began producing music at the age of 14 after finding some free software on the coverdisk of a magazine! What started as a diversion soon became a passion and by the age of 18 he had played his first major festival and turned down a record contract. James continued to teach himself about music and production, and slowly built up a small recording studio learning as he went along. When the late John Peel played the track 'Wotsa Voy' on Radio 1 in January 2000, Skitchy had his validation.
However, music was not his only passion and at this stage he decided to branch into another form of entertainment - video games. Again, he taught himself from scratch, and over the next four years created and sold several games and apps, slowly building a brand called 'DyVision Works'.

As part of this process, James had learned a lot about 3D animation, and so in late 2005 he decided to make an animated CGI music video to accompany one of the songs from his 19 track album - as you do. Over the next 3 months he taught himself the bits he didn't know and the 'Lethargy My Friend' music video was born. This went on to get major airtime on several large TV networks including MTV, and reached the top 10 chart on Video-C alongside such well established artists as Madonna and Massive Attack, reflecting its cult following on the net. It was also recognised as a short film in its own right making appearances at film festivals like OneDotZero in London due to its underlying message about bullying, a subject about which Skitchy feels strongly as he pinpoints it as the root cause of many of his own issues.

Concurrently, the album was getting played on stations around the world (USA, UK, Europe, Australia and beyond), and the track 'Funk Around' was chosen to be pre-loaded on to over a million new MP3 players as part of a Dixons Group promotion in the UK.

""Cut up vocals and a bassline that rumbles deep from the speakers. Taken from a whole album of quality!"" - Rob Da Bank, BBC Radio 1.

Skitchy’s second video “Tiny Little Freaks”, (produced and animated entirely by - you guessed it - James himself) was again picked up by MTV International as well as winning a place in the final of the 2007 IMAs. You really need to watch this video closely because (like ogres and onions) its theme has many layers. A two year old will be transfixed by the odd cartoon characters and bright shiny colours, and an elderly politician will balk at its stark sociopolitical jabs - some of which are in your face and some you have to hunt for.

While working on some new material, Skitchy was approached by numerous artists and labels. For some he wrote and produced remixes and for one (Chichino) he made another animation to accompany one of their tracks.

Skitchy released his second album titled 'How Can This Little Brother Recoup' on his own label DyVision Music. Commercial without being cheesy, diverse not esoteric, and edgy rather than grating. It ranges from a bass-bin rupturing mosh through unashamed booty-shaking to a mid-day drunk mellow.

But don't expect to see Skitchy himself - unless you can find his house.

His distinct style of sound originates not only from his unique ability as a Music Producer, DJ and composer but also from his talent as a songwriter and vocalist.
 
In 2011, Amurai contributed as a producer and songwriter in developing ATB's 8th studio artist album entitled ""Distant Earth."" The album peaked at #7 in the German Billboard Charts and later reached Platinum status in sales. Later that year, Amurai was invited by ATB to participate in ""ATB In Concert"", hosted in Poznan, Poland, to play live piano and close out the concert with a DJ set.
 
Ferry Corsten, a famed Dutch label owner and DJ, spotted Amurai and featured him in two of his highly regarded “Once Upon A Night” compilations. Amurai was the only artist to have two songs featured on each of the two compilation series.
 
Throughout his career, the young music producer managed to secure releases on some of Europe’s most highly respectable electronic dance music labels such as Armada Recordings and Black Hole Recordings. Amurai, who often finds inspiration from his Armenian roots, has garnered immense support from high ranking DJs including Tiesto, Armin Van Buuren, ATB, Above & Beyond, Gareth Emery, and Dash Berlin among others.
 
In the first quarter of 2009, Amurai started his DJ career by launching his own internationally broadcasted electronic radio show called ‘Amurai Global’. The show aired on over 10 online and FM radio stations and was also available as a podcast. One year later, Amurai joined the LMD Group in Los Angeles and claimed residency on Saturdays at Club Circus. His residency enabled him to DJ alongside artists such as Cosmic Gate, tyDi, Solarstone, Tritonal, Simon Patterson and Solarstone while representing the Trance music scene in Los Angeles.

Wyro started making beats back in distant 1999 while he was living in small Siberian city Surgut. Surrounded by snow and cold winter wind he started exploring Fast Tracker audio software and building his unique music style - warm and fun as summer night. His first love was atmospheric jungle and drum&bass and his first tracks were made in this genre but after years of experiments, hundreds of gigs around the world and releases on such respected d&b labels as Formation, Med School, Fokuz, Covert Operations and Blu Saphir he found himself comfortable in the deeper side of Minimal House & Techno. For his production Kirill is using lots of hardware synths, including a modular case and a few old school synths.

    uncharacteristically sequestering himself away from any of the various local music scenes. Yet he was quietly- 
    and prolifically- experimenting and recording countless tracks during the night... injecting life into hardware
    perceived by many as lifeless, constructing analog-soaked journeys into the subconscious, manipulating waves
    of resonant frequencies into genre-bending bursts of sound... pulling soul out of equipment that supposedly
    has none. Bob Darker- working with a practically paranormal level of interaction and understanding between man and

Even though I learnt the piano when I was 7, I only became interested in writing music when I was 13. What inspired that? Video games & film OSTs.

I graduated from Singapore Polytechnic in 2010 with a Diploma in Music & Audio Technology and have since been working as a music composer for various media mediums. I put on the music producer hat occasionally to do album/song productions & arrangements and enjoy writing concert music in my own leisure time. I will be taking a Masters in Scoring for Film & Visual Media at Pulse College (Dublin) and am excited to announce that I am the recipient of the NAC (National Arts Council) Singapore 2015 Arts Scholarship (Postgraduate) as well as the 2015/2016 Conrad Pope Scholarship (from Pulse College).

As a film composer, I have been fortunate to have worked on a diverse range of feature films such as Dolph Lundgren’s action flick – “Battle Of The Damned” (2012) & Tony Kern’s Horror movie – “After Images” (2013). I also had a hand in scoring the first Singapore film to open for the Singapore International Film Festival (SGIFF) – Ken Kwek’s black comedy/drama “Unlucky Plaza” (2014). My latest feature score (in 2015) is a (yet to be released) horror movie by Kelvin Tong – “The Faith Of Anna Waters” (2015) which stars Elizabeth Rice & Matthew Settle.

I hope that you will enjoy my music and if you feel that I am the right fit for your project please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,                                                                       Si Hao

“I know you”…”You are fucking great” … (you and me) …
it will come… it can't be stopped ... it just intensifies… comes suddenly…Sometimes can leave all at once… (Long ago I tried to think that it would never come back anymore …but it always does…), and remembers about me. She needs me like I need her…We are indispensable two forms ... We can not exist without each other…She needs a lot – feelings, situations, emotions – all these that are raised to the third power…She absorbs them with an incredible force and spits it out with a bang. If she’s gone – and you want her incredibly right now – you have to feel this strange and very unpleasant feeling of emptiness and dissatisfaction of many things. Yesterday she told me that she feels a lot. She showed me how to scream when your mouth is closed. If she had come and left you in two minutes then wait her in a few hours at least for five. She is uncontrolled and a fool for you... and if she leaves you then she has gone for food to you - as longer she's out - as tasty this food will be... She ""knows where"" it can be found and brings the most delicious food you've ever tried. So she knew why she was gone! She has mercy upon nobody. I am always under her thumb. When she asks me -  not to sleep - I don't, asks not to eat - I don't eat…She makes me scream all the time. She feeds me, she sneers me, she uses me…and with the help of this she shows herself, her beauty, omnipotence, blinking attraction …

Fuck! Should I really tell? – It’s forever…!
I know her…SHE IS FUCKING NICE GREAT

Bennie’s thoughtful songwriting and her passion for the material make for soul-nourishing music that speaks to the spirit while reaching a broad range of listeners. 
<br>
The single Talk about It features all of Bennie’s best traits: mesmerizing melodies, distinctiveness and uplifting lyrics. A strong emotional heart beats in this song, one in which Bennie ably shares her faith and her love of music with others, not by telling them about it but by making them feel it. Bennie doesn’t describe her emotions in this song; rather, she frees them from her heart and places them lovingly in that of the listener. Her smooth, sparkling vocals, smile-inducing and heartwarming melodies and emotional honesty cause the fan to drop his or her guard and step right into the welcoming warmth of this song. 
<br>
“I think music really speaks to people” says Bennie, “and it is something we feed ourselves with every day.”  Talk about It is Bennie opening her heart to others and encouraging them to do the same. It is about the spirit inside and the healing it seeks. “I think attitudes can be changed depending on the type of music involved, and more so, music has the ability to speak to inner pain, secrets, whatever is inside and draw emotion out of you.”
<br>
For Bennie, the study of dance, with a nudge from her faith, expanded to singing and songwriting. Her zeal for music-related arts and love for God, not to mention God-given talent, made her path plain to her. She shares her own pains and joys of life through her music especially in songs such as You Don’t Have to Smile and It’s Gonna Be Alright to help others relate and find comfort. She offers her spirituality as an invitation for others to look up while their ears are tuned in to her inspirational brand of song craft.
<br>
Bennie just put on an acoustic mini tour along the East Coast and Nashville, March 7th-14th and is now planning more shows back in Indianapolis . She’s very fan friendly and enjoys meeting and talking with listeners when she has the opportunity. 
<br>
Bennie is currently working with A&R Select, the world’s leading independent artist development firm, based out of Los Angeles, CA. “I just want to keep playing as much as I can, writing as honestly as possible and getting to meet and talk to people at shows,” Bennie says, demonstrating her down-to-earth approach and her genuine concern for others. Her music, she believes, is more than just for fun, though it is that. Bennie has a message of happiness, hope, faith and love to share with others. “If even one person walks away moved, then I have done my job.”",21,0,,,0,13375,user,2009-03-05T17:27:58Z,,0,0,kristapopmusic,https://soundcloud.com/kristapopmusic,0,,2,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/13375,soundcloud:users:13375,kristapopmusic,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:13375,artist-stations:13375,free,,,,,False,False,False,

This was the moto which lead Ariel Gilboa and Guy Rotem to create music in the years 2008-2009.

The two are old friends with history on dance floors but neither is a fully fledged music producer. Guy has been a DJ since the year 2000 and Ariel is an audiophile with many years of experience in capturing moments in life with his camera. The two became friends through the ‘IsraelUnderground’ community, today a blog (http://iublog.me) backed up by a Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Israel-Underground/159317810765463).

The two decided to make an attempt to translate a constant flow of scattered ideas and sounds running through their heads into coherent tracks. This was not an attempt to become famous producers but rather a very enthusiastic meeting of two minds working hard in order to merge into one.

Now years later with some of the sounds still penetrating otherwise locked areas in their brains Ariel and Guy decided to put their moto to the test, proving that good music has no age nor boundaries.

This is Ironica.

Finally getting the vast majority of his record collection out of storage and beginning to get back in the studio.

Ever since playing at one of the original raves in Paris at the tender age of 17, you only need hear him play for a matter of minutes to know that his attitude to music is fundamentally the same and that his objective is to make people dance. His history working in record stores and selling vinyl records has given him the opportunity to get years of valuable face-to-face feedback on the music from the then thriving community that was listening to it.

Adamant that “those who try to be trendy out-trend themselves” he has consistently tried using his label DPR to release the music he loves. With releases dating back to 1997 it was the first outlet for his seminal Groove Chronicles project where began to push his unique hybrid sound. With tracks such as “Angel Body”, “Stone Cold” and “Black Puppet” still in heavy rotation many credit the project as one of the key foundations that musical movements such as 2step/dubstep and grime were built upon.

Over the course of his extensive career, A Sides has never limited himself to a single style and has proved to be a highly capable selector whatever style he is drawing for. 

Reaching out with a sound that has truly global appeal, A Sides continues to tour the world over and 2013 has seen him grace the turntables in places like Sardinia, Russia, Poland, Amsterdam, Hungary, New Zealand, Canada and the USA. 

Jason Cambridge (aka A Sides) has been producing music since 1990 and has released well over 500 tracks to date across many of the scene’s biggest labels. 

He established his own label Eastside Records in 1996 and has since put out over 85 releases, including two compilation albums (Eastside Jamz Volumes 1 & 2) as well as A Sides solo albums ""Follow The Groove"" ""Worldwide"" ""Mysterious Vibes"" and the most recent album album ""Based Upon Bass""

A highly accomplished engineer as well as an artist in his own right, A Sides has collaborated with the likes of Calibre, Makoto, DJ Marky, Break, Jo-S, Kemo, Deeizm, Mc Mc, Randall, Jenna G, Mark de Clive-Lowe and jazz musician Nathan Haines (under the guise of Sci-Clone) 

His long-standing partnership with MC Fats has borne some of his biggest tracks to date, including the massive hit ""What U Don’t Know"" which featured on A Sides’ debut long-player in 2003.
To catch the pair performing live is to hear drum & bass at it’s finest, with the deep soul sound of MC Fats bringing the perfect complement to A Sides razor sharp beats.

With tracks released on many other labels such as Metalheadz, Valve, True Playaz, Bingo, Innerground, Reinforced, Advanced, Liqweed Ganja and Hospital to name but a few, A Sides has a discography of truly epic proportions. 

A veteran of the scene from the early days, through hardcore to jungle to drum & bass, his influence has been immense. Over the years he’s taken on the role A&R for many labels, including of course his own imprints Fuze and Eastside, and was among the first to recognize and nurture the talent of producers such as Break.

Always moving forward and shaping new styles, in 2008 he established BassHead Music together with Juan BassHead aka DJ Burn to showcase the finest in dubstep and bass heavy beats. 

After a successful debut (feat. 12th Planet and Skream) there have been releases from Otto Von Schirach, Noah D feat. Einstein, Datsik, Bassnectar, Silver, Bare, Break, Serum, Figure, Hulk, Zed's Dead & The Killabits & Wheez-ie. Following this a compilation album All Killer No Filler was also release seeing Basshead regulars stepping up alongside new artists such as Mr Explicit, Total Science, DJ Sneak, Jah Free, Code 305, Animal Crackerz, Agzilla and Bats.

With a diverse music policy, encompassing not just dubstep but other bass-heavy beats, BassHead has some exciting projects in the making over the next 12 months. To add icing on the cake Basshead have also just won the 2013 Red Bull Culture Clash in Miami making them a force to be reckoned with. 

A Sides has also recently added a digital arm to Eastside Records and made the entire back-catalogue available for mp3 download from digital store Beatport. For most of 2013 he has been the figurehead behind a fundraising album for his good friend MC Fats who has been suffering with health problems. He has managed to compile an album with over 30 tracks from many high profile artists. Those involved are S.P.Y, Makoto, Command Strange, Goldie, Bailey, Serum & Bladerunner, D-Bridge, London Electricty, DJ Zinc, DJ Hype, Potential Bad Boy, Will Miles, Random Movement, Brother, DJ S.I.N, Crix, Cleveland Watkiss, Total Science, Calibre, Need For Mirrors, Quadrant , Iris & Kid Hops, TC, Cabin Fever, Break & Die, Basher, Alix Perez, Emtek, LAOS, Mackadena, MC Random, XRS, Regina, Ego Trippin & Mr Explicit. 

Other projects set for 2014 are a new A Sides solo album and also a joint collaboration album with Japanese producer  Makoto. The future is looking bright!

Including recent releases and remixes on labels like Affin, Dialtone, Gung Ho!, Arabica, Illegal Ninja Moves, Revolucion and too many others to mention. As the owner of a local record shop in Reykjavik and the brainchild behind countless parties over the years he is considered by many as the man largely responsible for creating the healthy clubscene that exists in Reykjavik today. Known both as an excellent producer and remixer Sean is also a well respected Dj in his own right and over the years has shared the dj booth with many leading names from Sasha, Digweed, Sander Kleinenberg, Nick Warren, Josh Wink and Steve Lawler through to Dubfire, Richie Hawtin, Layo &amp; Bushwacka and many many more.

Having been soaked in the 80s electronic music invasion since an early age, he bought his first synthesiser from a waitress in a cocktail bar and it would never stay in tune. 

Many musical dreams and a couple of dinky instruments later, Acid House arrived. Acelera's musical coming of age took place during DJ Pippi's reign of the main room at Pacha. Spurred on by this, he put together a little home studio, honing his craft and eventually working with most of the local studios and producers. The wildly varied local scene meant that he got to work on an ample gamut of genres, ranging from the acoustic to the deeply electronic. Some names he remembers fondly include Lenny Ibizarre (Warner/Ibizarre), Juan Verdera (Muses Rapt), Domi Pastor (Dropland), MiDMiND (Podenco Recordings) and Chris Hinze (Keytone/Sony).

A few years back now, he left his native White Isle behind and took the chance to move to London. In the creative comfort of his new home, he has rediscovered his passion for wielding melodies and beats out of overheating synths and samplers. Nowadays, time is spent between the UK and Spain again. Also, Carl Helder from New Jersey has joined as a permanent fixture of the Acelera output.

English:

Half Spanish, half Chilean, and a compulsive vinyl digger since 1997, this Aragonese artist has worked as a DJ/producer and music manager at Dj MAG ES and Mixmag Spain.

1999 and the year 2000 were key turning points. After moving to Barcelona, BFDD discovered its legendary clubs – Razzmatazz, Nitsa, BeCool, and Florida 135 in Fraga. Soaking up the club culture of the age, such electronic temples were the sites of a musical awakening that would unfold into a deep investigation into sounds of the past. This was essential in helping to map out a path when finding his own voice as a DJ and producer.

With over two decades of experience on the national and international scene, BFDD has managed to create a unique and indelible style, enlisting a broad array of perfectly tessellated sounds, freely encompassing a variety of genres: Disco, Leftfield, Techno, IDM, New wave, EBM, Dark disco or Electro. Currently, BFDD can be counted among today’s top artists in terms of global reach and influence. Some of his many projects include: Festival LESF, VA, and Electric Selectors – an itinerant club in which his personal vision is combined with a commitment to promoting young, emerging talent.

2021 has been a breakthrough year for BFDD as a producer. An initial release on Panal Records, a first-time vinyl titled “Arp Battery”, created alongside the Argentine DJ and producer Marzian for ODD Pleasures (Berlin), led to remixes from artists of the stature of Freudenthal, Daniel Monaco, Adrian Marth or Random Atlas.

After a meteoric and exciting 2019/2022, he has shared a booth with artists such as: Sofia Kourtesis, Boris Dolinski, Mistery Affair, Jenifer Cardini, Ame, Konstantin Sibold, Perel, Map.ache, Freudenthal, Carol Mattos, Paula Tape, John Tejada, Alejandro Paz, Serge Santiago, Alvaro Cabana, Javi Redondo, Fernanda Arrau, Daniel Monaco among many others... 

BFDD’s sets have featured at clubs and events such as: Bar Oriente (Cdmx) Sunday Sunday(Mx) Cafe Berlin, Millenium Festival (Paris), Rituel Days (Paris), Razzmatazz, Be Cool, Feinstoff (Berlin), Bellmer (Berlin), Operator (Rotterdam), Rinse FM (Paris), Noa Noa (Santiago de Chile), Sao Paulo (Brasil), Espacio 93 (Chile).",1000,1995,Space is the place,Space is the place,0,13575,user,2022-02-23T22:59:36Z,,1143,89,blackflamingodiscodriver,https://soundcloud.com/blackflamingodiscodriver,6,,5,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/13575,soundcloud:users:13575,Black FLamingo Disco Driver,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:13575,artist-stations:13575,creator-pro-unlimited,soundcloud:users:13575,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:146658747', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000013575-DKAnBf-original.jpg'}]",,False,True,False,

His productions have been described as fresh and innovative by some of the leading players in electronic music and his records have been consistently backed by the big names that count. Combining elements of House, Trance, Progressive and leftfield Electronica, as well throwing in some rock influences, Dale is now starting to mix it with the big boys.

After and string of high quality releases on imprints like Napith, High Contrast, Vandit and Perfecto, Dale has launched his own imprint - CDRY.

“There are no genre restraints which allows me to be creative and experimental. I’m not jumping on bandwagons or staying within one tight niche with this label”.

Being open minded and extremely versatile is very definitely his modus operandi. Always keen to show he’s not scared of fusing big melodies and great vocals, Dale is constantly looking to deliver fresh sounding material that works on dance floors and as well as through headphones.

His recent production, for Perfecto Records, the highly flammable ‘Kerosene’ is another mould breaker. Co-written with members of seminal rock-trance act ‘Dogzilla’ and indie band ‘Belasco’. Corderoy takes guitars and vocals and mashes them within an inch of their lives to create this totally original sounding hybrid club anthem. Paul Oakenfold, the label’s owner, loved the track so much he just asked Corderoy to remix one of his classics ‘Ready Steady Go’.

As Dale stamps his unique mark in dance music this year risks will be taken, boundaries battered down and ultimately his music will filter into the ears of the masses.

Some of the world’s most influential DJ’s, such as Richie Hawtin have played Francesco Tarallo’s work and he has received great praise from many throughout the industry including a spot in James Holden Top 10 Charts in the Groove Magazine.

From a very early age he has been drawn to the sounds of electronic production.  First discovering beats through old school hip hop, gradually as his own music developed, he continued to draw influences from a wide range of artists from many genres including jazz, funk, experimental, and classical.

In 2004 he was scouted by record label Trapez (a major player in the electronic music scene in Germany) and put out several releases including “Sogno EP” on Trapez Ltd., Vertrieb Kompakt, and Rifare on Trapez “Selection 3” Mix Compilation.  His next opportunity came with indie label Pentagonik in which he released „Kingston“ on Pentagonik “Compilation 2” to high acclaim across the country. Other deep Dub Techno influenced releases on Lucidflow Records and Superordinate Dub Waves were following.

With over 20 years of experience, Francesco Tarallo offers a great mix of many electronic music flavors.  Expect to find him punching out 12hr sets with an emphasis on hard pace, or getting in touch with his experimental-ambient side, while feeling his soul during a deep house set is guaranteed.  These are just a few of the flavors that Francesco Tarallo offers.  One thing that is the same each set is that he offers the punters a night to remember, with a vibe that only Francesco Tarallo can bring.

He played together with stars of the scene like Prosumer (Ostgut Ton), Osunlade (Yoruba), Marcel Dettmann (Hardwax), Daniel Bell (Accelerate) a.s.o, as well in the famous Berghain/Panoramabar Club in Berlin and diverse Radio Stations.",256,88,Francesco,Francesco Tarallo,0,13585,user,2020-04-02T11:20:08Z,Tarallo,21,4,francesco,https://soundcloud.com/francesco,1,,10,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/13585,soundcloud:users:13585,Francesco,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:13585,artist-stations:13585,free,soundcloud:users:13585,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:93169497', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000013585-XIpOg9-original.jpg'}]",,False,False,False,

For better or worse, the tracks I create can often sound a little different to much of the electronic music out there. I like to think my music exists in its own little universe of echoes, reflections and call backs. 

Success? I’ve had a little. Over the years I’ve collaborated with Ellie Goulding, Max Richter, Leann Rimes and Kylie Minogue amongst others. I’ve produced a top ten record (Billboard/OCC) for Neon Jungle and I’ve written music for movies like The Shallows (with Blake Lively) and Rough Night (with Scarlett Johansson).

If you’d like to hear something different, well here I am: I'm waiting for you with warm, open arms, inviting to you to join me on this journey of love, passion and melancholia.

The groove...that moment of wonder in music where the experience moves beyond simply hearing the music....you feel the music. That's where Bill and his music find their home...in the ""groove"".

Bill sees music as he sees the Word of God. When you open yourself up and allow the rhythm and feeling behind the words to move you, to speak to you personally....it becomes much more than just words on a page or chords on a chart. You don't just hear it, you feel it. It becomes part of you. ""Carry the Word of God in your heart like a song..."" Which songs live in your heart? The songs that meet you where you are and in who you are. They establish themselves through the groove that they create.

His debut CD, ""Wonder"", is a collection of ten original songs that draws upon on a vast range of influences -- blues, funk, country, rock, Southern Gospel, Contemporary, P&W -- woven together with an underlying acoustic groove. ""Wonder"" draws hearts to worship, celebration and reflection, as each song presents a unique message and experience to listeners.

With releases on Liquid V, Chronic, Mac II, Good Looking, Innerground,Rubik, and a slew of other labels his music keeps going from strength to strength. Born to a radio DJ father he was raised listening to slew of different music genres that led him to hip hop and later on, drum and bass. Always fascinated with watching the dj's in hip hop videos, Jaybee obtained his first set of turntables at the age of 13 and started playing hip hop. A few years later he was intrigued by a friends ""techno"" compilation and wore out the hit the decks megamix series tape and found his love in breakbeats which led him to a outlaw Jungle party thrown by Digital Konfusion.  It was at this event that Jaybee first discovered Jungle while witnessing DJ ODI double set ray Kieth's ""terrorist"", discovering it was possible to incorporate hip hop skills into Jungle. Flash forward 20 years and you can find him djing a weekly show on bassdrive.com every other Sunday from 10AM to 12PM EST. or in the studio working on whatever idea may roll through his head that day. His music is currently getting support by the likes of Bryan Gee, Randall, LTJ Bukem, Marky, D Bridge, A-Sides, PFM and Random Movement amongst a host of others.

Industry credits:
Kenny Metcalf was the original A&R for JavaMusic.com.

Javamusic.com pioneered many of the current tools used today in websites such as these and kenny was a part of that, handling 8000+ artists from around the globe. Google ""Kenny Metcalf""

Kenny was continually speaking on ""Global Distribution"" for indie artists and how to market their music without Giving away their rights.

Justa Band....

Had a few different single releases.. ""Nothing More To Say"" -1988 recorded at the Mixing lab by David Jahnsen, and ""You Want To Be A Star""-1997 recorded at Kenny Metcalf/MajorLabelRecordCo.com studio's.

Our first real full length studio release CD was released late summer of 1999, Justa Band ""Under Construction"".

Kenny never fully released the CD due to his committment to being A&R for JavaMusic and his 8,000 artists.

A little bad press never hurts.....

One thing that gave it (Under Construction CD) some press (BAD PRESS), 4 of the songs from the ""Under Construction"" CD were added to a special compilation CD released in 2001 called ""Stryper Expo Sampler"" which is still in circulation today. 

That CD is a compilation of works Robert Sweet the drummer of Stryper either played on, or produced. Roberts background is Metal music, and my style is all over the place (pop, rock, light jazz, easy listening, R&B), so when my 4 songs were added to a metal head project... it was a ""Train Wreck"", but again gave ""Justa Band"" more public vision internationally via the internet and Stryper's name, even with the bad press.

The Justa Band ""Under Construction"" CD has never gone out of print and is release on our self indie label where it is also visible to the public www.MajorLabelRecordCo.com

Personal stuff about

Kenny -

""I don't write for commercial appeal. I really don't want to sound like everyone else"". 

""I love to tell storys with my songs. A song should paint a picture and tell a story"".

 ""I write because I love music and the emotions a melody can bring to the surface and the lyrical content that will follow"".

I don't believe you have to spam everyone to ""VOTE"" for a song, pay for play and the like has dumbed down the music systems of today.

On the net... If your music is good.. post it and leave it. Let it speak for itself. If it gains popularity, your success is genuine, but if all your friends just bump your music to gain you a false look of success, believe me.. no one will buy it and your 15 seconds of fame will fade as well. 

""When you can play because you love music and not because you desire to be discovered, riches or fame, then you have crossed the line that allows God to really speak through you and your music.""

He's perfected an irreverent blend of disco house and party breaks playing for crowds from Alaska to Miami to London's BBC Radio 1. If ADAN were a record, he'd be the slightly warped, late night party starter. 

Multiple releases in the early 2000s solidified a well received and cross genre approach that helped to define the Tech Funk sound. Production work and remixes for domestic and international labels garnered rave reviews in iDJ, Mixmag and URB magazine, as well as in many big name DJ charts. Stints as a music reviewer for LA based website Bijoubeats.com (2006-2008) and writer/reviewer for Elite Force's UK music blog Tech Funk Manifesto (2008-2012) followed, allowing for a years long running commentary of the dance scene and its ever changing soundtrack. 

These days the loop life has brought the focus back to the studio with a few Texas producers.

Biography:

Until today the widespread ramifications of the great success of his first gig as a live act at Berlin’s Berghain have been paving the way for Broombeck’s musical career and his inseparable baggage of drum machines and synths.
They are rooted in his love and passion for the authentic and sincere brand of his music. Ever since 2008, both as a dj and as a live act, Broombeck has been discharging this permanently techno power, the intensity of which is channelled into a controlled climax.
With his gigs at innumerable clubs or famous festivals and with his internationally celebrated productions, Broombeck has made a name for himself. Whoever has seen Broombeck performing, live or as dj, will never forget that night. His releases on Herzblut, Elevate, Octopus Recordings or Terminal M not only figure in record sleeves or on playlists of global players, but also on the dancefloor of well-known clubs in New York, London, Barcelona and Belgrad.
Ever since the release of his track „The Clapper“ in 2008, Broombeck has won a world-wide renown. In the same year, with his track „Mono Turn“, for more than six weeks he topped the Beatport charts and ranked in the top five of the Beatport annual charts. Various releases on renowned compilations like „Timewarp Compilation“ or „Headliners“ go along with collaborations, productions and remixes for well known artists such as Felix Kröcher, AKA AKA and Monika Kruse.
To give more creative space to his musical output, Broombeck created his own label „Yes We Can“ in 2014, fusing with precision techno sounds radiating minimal music.
The mix of drums, bass, fx sounds and synthesizer in his tracks resembles a harmoniously tuned machinery, in which each cog-wheel fits in its right place and imparts its pulsating power to this techno mechanism. Wherever he is or performs, in his studio or in public as a dj or as a live act, Broombeck lives and breathes techno.

Their dark, rich pop is laced with lush melodies, sonically complex landscapes and incisive lyrics that open a window on day-to-day life. 
Formed in 2007, Friends Of Mine started with a single studio session that led to a blur of song writing over the next few years. Over time, the 40-something tracks written were whittled down to “Are You Looking”, their debut five track EP, which was released digitally in July 2011. 
Hailing from vastly different musical backgrounds, the diversity of this duo is what gives it its unique sound. Skating the lines of indie, pop and electronica, Friends Of Mine is a beautiful bi-product of Tim's ARIA award winning singer/songwriter talent combined with Jono's internationally recognised production skills.
Previously front man for Australian act Taxiride, Tim Watson is no stranger to number 1 records, double Platinum singles, ARIA awards, and touring the world, even having a Wembley Stadium live performance as a feather to his achievements cap. Beyond his previous incarnation as the lead singer and songwriter of one of Australia's biggest pop rock success stories of the late 90s, Tim's also a talented producer and writer having previously worked with a number of Australian artists including Australian Idol finalist Rob Mills.
The move into band world for Jono Fernandez is less a departure from his dance music history and more of a full circle going back to his roots – from age 13 Jono played guitar and vocals for an indie-grunge band whilst still at school. At age 15, bitten by the underground progressive house music bug, Jono ditched the guitar for production software and started producing dance music. His first release was in 2002, and since then he's released some 50 singles and remixes on some of the world's most respected dance music labels including Global Underground, One Love and Ministry of Sound. 
With a number of sync’s already coming their way prior to any commercial release, the future looks promising for these two talented friends. We hope Friends Of Mine become friends of yours.

He has produced over 100 releases and remixes for acclaimed labels Dessous, Poker Flat, Crosstown Rebels, Systematic, Bunny Tiger, Katermukke, Bar 25 Music, Superfett and his own, Ladies and Gentlemen. His career first exploded in 2004 with club anthems “The Red Dress” and “For the Time Being”, but it was his track ‚Feel What You Want’ with its over 50.000.000 clicks on Youtube from his 2010 album, which earned him global recognition. Phonique’s four critically-praised albums attest to his evolving, diverse influences, deep knowledge of house music, and masterful intuition to serve the dance floor. While he is currently working on an acoustic album to be released in 2021, he is preparing some fresh Disco-House tunes as well as more tracks for Bar 25 Music. Phonique continues to draw huge crowds, invitations to perform around the world, and collaborations with artists across Europe, South America, and beyond.
In 2019 Dave DK and Phonique established the project „How V Dance“ to raise awareness for veganism in the electronic music industry with the early support from fellow vegans like Coyu, Moby or Ida Engberg.

Been DJ'ing off and on but had a big break from Music because of starting a family and moving to Wales. I went digital about 5 years ago as i have a love for technology and birth of Digital DJ'ing was something i just had to look into and this brings me to where i am today.

I cover most Genres and really only play what i like, not to please. This ethos would be completely different if i was playing to a crowd but as most of my sets are for a online radio station, i play what i like and hope people will enjoy my selection in Music.
