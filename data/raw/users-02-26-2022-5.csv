Their trademark, stripped back deep house sound has hypnotised party people across the UK and Europe, and it’s no surprise that their touring schedule has been packed throughout 2011.

DZeta N’ Basile hit the bigtime when they were asked to remix Robert Owens’ ‘I’ll Be Your Friend’ as part of a package of remixes by the world’s hottest producers, including Jamie Jones, Soul Clap & Gadi Mizrahi, Matt Tolfrey & Inxec, Dyed Soundorom, and Jay Tripwire. The tune was a huge hit all summer and got played on dance floors across the globe. In the past year their name has constantly rocketed to the top of the Beatport charts, with further singles and remixes alongside the likes of Nina Kraviz, Burnski, Alex Jones, Silicon Soul and Nicole Moudaber, Robert Owens, Lattner, Huxley and Franky Flowerz to name a few.

Alongside their commitment in the studio, the boys have had a prolific run in terms of DJing, with gigs notched up for Room 1 in Fabric, Ministry Of Sound, The End and Egg amongst many. Their playful rhythms and brooding bass lines have captured the imaginations of revelers on dance floors across the UK and Europe, and their rapport behind the decks is palpable.

With an impressive number of singles and remixes out recently, and a load more in the pipeline on highly rated labels such as ViVa MUSiC, Abkal Music, Plastic City and Raw Cutz their achievements are now the envy of many, and the future looks bright.

Alongside his trademark sound, Till von Sein exudes an aura of noble grandeur mixed with the genuine enthusiasm of a child with a favourite toy when he's busy in the DJ booth. But  Tilly’s toy, which in this case is house and its countless derivatives, won’t ever end up forgotten in the corner. Long after the wrapping paper has been thrown away, what Till loves has yet to lose its magic. For von Sein, the sound of an 808 clap triggers a state of ecstasy, which in his hands emerges as pure euphoria on the dance floor. Time and again, his thumping transitions and heart-racing sets send listeners into overdrive, revealing the very core of house, soul and techno, while hitting on just what makes these genres so exciting.

Despite his intimate knowledge of the industry, which might allow him to slip easily into a been-there-done-that attitude, Till von Sein shows non-stop enthusiasm. For the last ten years, he has run the internationally active Clique Bookings at the side of Claudia Marquardt. More recently, his work as a producer has grown to encompass a vast catalogue of releases on labels such as Suol, Dirt Crew and Supplement Facts. He has collaborated with artists such as Tigerskin, Aera, Chopstick and Catz’n’Dogz, and his DJ work has long been a fixture in the international club scene. After his 2011 solo album ""#LTD"" (Suol), von Sein enjoyed a fully booked calendar and successful tour through South Africa, Japan, USA and Europe. He continues to ride a wave of success. In 2013, he released his personal contribution to the Suol Mates mix series, and further EP releases are in the works. Upcoming projects for 2014 include a new solo album and a project with producer and friend Tigerskin.

K_Chico is planing a tour ""France / Belgium"" for october - feel free to contact for info!
------------
K_Chico released his debut album ""When I Was Young"" in 2006 on the Teichmann- Brothers' ""Festplatten"" label. The release quickly found its way into the playlists of Electro luminaries such as GusGus, Ellen Alien, Chloe, Wighnomy Brothers, Munk etc. This in turn set off a chain of releases on Forcetracks, Rundlauf and the Bar25 label. As his touring schedule started to thicken and his career properly took off, K_Chico just walked away from it all.
Now - 5 years later - he is back with ""Burn"" - the first track from his new album, which will be released later on this year. The song comes with a visually intense music video produced and directed by the man himself. The production is based on the morphing effect and required hundreds of unique stills. The famous Champagne producers ""Bollinger,"" who normally only sponsor James Bond movies, liked the test shots so much that they donated entire cases of their product to the crew. K_Chico is back!

Cosmokolor has always been driven by musical sounds and melodies since his early years till it became his way of living in late 90s. Ever since getting his first vinyl the irreversible electronic journey begins. Always curious and evolving, his mind is infinitely open to new sounds, instruments, effects and technology as soon as novelties are present in the electronic scene. Deriving inspiration from everything - tribal sounds to Motown legends, deep industrial grinds to sunset melodies, hip-hop to Kraftwerk, Cosmokolor always surprises you with his sets and makes sure the audience is happy. Cosmokolor was an essential part of the infamous underground parties that Geneva is so known for. Having played with the likes of Radioslave, Sebo K, he is always eager to share the musical experience with others seeking to surprise and engage through his experimental yet well-established style. In Geneva, he has organized various events at Piment Rouge and was also responsible for the line-up at Jack’s house, introducing artists such as Dachshund (Harthouse), Warlich (Eminor), and Ed Davenport (Liebe detail), Crowdpleaser & St Plomb (Mental Groove) and many more. Constantly present in the swiss music scene, Cosmokolor has performed in many clubs in Switzerland as Pipping Club, Crème, Zoo, la Ruche as well as at numerous festivals as Electron and Overground. In 2007 he began producing his own tracks and signed his first maxis Doggy Bag, Royal Flash and White Chicks with italian label Kina Music. In 2012 he releases Camille and Natural Garden on Chupa Records label. His multidimensional perception and love for electronic music is also reflected in the mixes one can listen on his web radio Ayeko. Be sure to hear proper passionate techno any time of the day.

For over 20 years, Jeff Samuel has been releasing quality dance music which blurs the lines between house and techno. It makes sense, his hometown of Cleveland is positioned 3 hours from Detroit and 6 hours from Chicago. Pulling influences from both cities as well as his own wider musical tastes, Jeff managed to create a sound all his own. Prominent artists such as Michael Mayer and Ricardo Villalobos caught onto his sound early on, remixing his 1st and 4th EP's. His funky and playful use of sound caught the attention of techno pioneer Daniel Bell, who released his ""New Joob"" EP on the legendary 7th City Records in 2001. Another early admirer was Steve Bug, who not only remixed Jeff's DC10 Ibiza anthem ""Knob"" for Trapez, but also signed him for a string of releases on his own Poker Flat label.

By 2005, Jeff was a regular on the European DJ circuit. He released his first mix CD for Poker Flat and began to attract more attention for his remixes. Artists as diverse as Hot Chip, Guido Schneider and Der Dritte Raum all received the Jeff Samuel remix treatment. From the dancefloor-centric music released on Spectral Sound and Morris Audio to more trippy releases on Contexterrior and Karloff, a common strain of humanity and personality is always inside Jeff's music. This culminated in ""Step"", his 2006 debut LP for Trapez which received 4.5 stars in Resident Advisor and was called ""timeless"" by Groove Magazine.

Now living in Berlin, Jeff's DJ profile continues to spread beyond the confines of Europe. he has appeared at top festivals such as MUTEK, DEMF/Movement, Decibel, Fusion and Overground. While he enjoys performing DJ sets at the world's finest clubs such as Panorama Bar and Fabric London, he also thrives in further territories such as Japan, China, Israel, South America and beyond. He is most known for his extended DJ sets, which give him more space to weave together different elements for sweaty dancefloors everywhere.

Today, Jeff is known as one of the most respected artists in underground dance music. This is reflected in the recent re-releases of his early work. The afterhours classic ""Lost"" was re-released in 2007, 6 years after its original release. In 2009, an onslaught of re-releases from Logistic and Trapez appeared alongside his new material. ""Timeless"" indeed.

Blake prefers spending most of his time in Berlin, although he travels often between his ""home away from home"" and Los Angeles, which is his home town. This balance of keeping one foot in each continent enriches his inspirations and sparks off his creativity.

""I am mostly here (in Berlin) because it is one of the most peaceful and creative cities in the world."" He explains.

He has been a resident in the German capital for nine years, seven of which he's been a member of the Electro Hip -Hop group, The Puppetmastaz, playing more than 500 concerts throughout Europe, with nearly half a million fans.

The PuppetMastaz is not the only group he plays with. On several occassions he has been seen alongside Marc Hype & Jim Dunloop (MPM Rec.), Le Peuple de l'Herbe (Discograph), DubFX (U.K.), M.A.P. (Pias Recordings), Da Flexiblez (Berlin Massive), Akanni (Mellowbag), Bleubird (Endemik Music), Subtitle (B.E.A.R. / Briefcase Rockers Ltd.), K-Chico (Festplatten & Rundlauf Musik), ZhiMC (Asian Trouble Tribe), Citizens Intrnational (C.I.T.), Girls United (Berlin) and Jayrope (Berlin).

He has opened shows for well known hip-hop icons like: Jeru the Damaja, Paris, Tha Alkaholiks, Lords Of The Underground, The Beatnuts and also Subtitle, Bleubird, Da Flexiblez and the PuppetMastaz France tour 2009.

He works with with many producers. Like beats from the more classic hip-hop drenched tracks of Mecs-Treem (Berlin), reminiscent of the so-called Golden Era of the 90's as well as the bass raps on Dub-Step-like pieces from Clintwood (Hamburg). Without any fear of mixing styles, Blake sings with a variety of voices which bring theatrical tones to the music.

The people working for this project are people that have dedicated most of their lives to the world of music or communication. 

Our project goals:
Inside our site you can listen to ItaliaNetwork, a radio that only plays dance music and only the music we select 24 hours a day. ItaliaNetwork has been the reference point of this music genre for many years and nowadays it is particularly dedicated to the future sounds all over the world. Our station has been created to exist within the web. Why?&nbsp; Simply because we want everybody in the world to be able to listen to it, without any boundaries of place, time, language. The radio liners “ no time, no space, no place ” are announcing a great revolution in our approach and implementation of the content of our radio.


As we said before ItaliaNetwork is living inside the web and it is housed in INmyradio. You may wonder which is the relationship between ItaliaNetwork and INmyradio.net.


All of this is IN…I love your music!

Italia Network Full history:
ITALIA NETWORK comes to life on July 12th 1982 in Udine. It broadcast “ONLY MUSIC, COOL MUSIC” as a famous jingle says. Its format is “TOP40”: the first 40 Top Hits of the moment on heavy rotation. The formula is simply but efficacious. Good music, no speakers and an original and pressing communication. The sticker with two stars is now firmly stuck over the windshield on many cars. A real trend. The expansion of the signal is helped by many local radio stations that resolve to repeat ITALIA NETWORK. The musical identity of the programs is more and more dance oriented and, in 1988, the House Music explosion. Ibiza is the center of the entertainment’s world and ITALIA NETWORK talk Spanish with the pay off “RITMO LATINO”. Comes to life LOS CUARENTA, DISCOSAURO and DISCONETWORK. Now is possible to listen this radio in near the whole Italy. House Music is becoming very important and ITALIA NETWORK becomes the Radio House pre-eminently. Comes to life MASTERMIX that will be the stage of the sets of the biggest Italian Djs. The first LOS CUARENTA compilation is published and will be on top on the official charts selling more than 200.000 copies. Comes to life NETWORK NEWS, an innovative news program customized on radio’s target. ITALIA NETWORK is very sensible about the new musical evolutions: now it’s time of SUBURBIA, MASTERQUICK, NETWORK SATELLITE, MAGAZINE, 100% RENDIMENTO, MAD HOUSE, LABIRINTO and HYPNO PARTY. In 1992 a summer tour in the most important Clubs in Italy is organized and the success is awesome. In that summer, on the August 23rd, a new law, called MAMMI’, from the name of his promoter, set the new rules in radio and television broadcasting system. ITALIA NETWORK become a national station and stop broadcast local commercials. The audience is growing bigger and the pay off is “GET UP AND DANCE”&nbsp; which ratify the dance spirit of the radio. The programs are becoming more articulate and it’s the moment of the voices for some of them. In 1994 the target of the radio is extended with the creation of a new revealing pay off “MORE MUSIC 4 EVERYBODY”.&nbsp; On 1995 the radio station moves from Udine to Bologna. The staff widen, comes new voices and new programs like PHILIP MORRIS SOUND, HISTORY, CLUSTER, SPORT’N MUSIC, SENSORAMA. On the weekends, on air, there are the mixed sessions of the London’s MINISTRY OF SOUND Djs. In 1998 the property is sold to the group SPER and the new pay off is “SUCK THE MUSIC”. &gt;From December 1st 1999 the radio broadcast not more from Bologna but from Milan. Radio Italia Network is now called RIN: “The radio which kidnap”, not only famous people from other radios but also from television and comes to life new radio shows like VITAMINA H, ORGASMATRON, WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE, HOUSE GALLERY. In 2002 the group SPER is sold to RCS – Corriere della Sera. The new pay off is “RADIO UN CORNO”. On August 31st 2005, RIN leaves the fm frequencies to make place to a new project called Play Radio, and becomes an Internet web radio with the name RIN Digital Radio. In 2007 also this project is dropped and in fact ITALIA NETWORK don’t exists no more…..

Here, he is like this.  Recognized connoisseur of all kind of electronic music, multifaceted like few others. From west to east, from north to south, Nunzio Borino is both the metronome and the compass of himself. You would never get lost with him.  Born in 1980, vinyl record collector and music lover in all its shapes. Hybrid sound, rich in contaminations, with 80's reminiscences, dark disco and waves;  this musical versatility makes Nunzio one of the most representative figure of Palermo’s  musical scene.  What he likes the most is to see how a good DJ melts his soul with the music, becoming one with the dancefloor: ""the magic of many people perfectly tuned to the same wavelength in a stimulating exchange of emotions"".  In 2003, he began to actively organize his parties, thus becoming the creator and resident DJ of the Free As We Are (Fawa), a young and weekly event of great prestige for the city of Palermo, a real revolution. Over the years he has had the opportunity to deal with the most important artists, playing all across Europe, from: // About Blank in Berlin, to the SPACE in Ibiza, passing through The Egg in London, the MOOM57  in La Coruna and the DEPO Klub in Zagreb.  In 2012 an important milestone, Nunzio was the first DJ to bring his DJ set to the majestic Teatro Massimo in Palermo, for the premiere of the opera ""La damnation de Faust"" directed by the visionary Terry Gilliam.  In addition, the book of Laurent Garnier and David Brun-Lambert, ""Electrochoc"" (published in Italy by KNM Music) sees him appearing among the special supporters.  Soul of the Nice To MEOW You! Brand  Party Designers;  protagonist of the crazy nights of the Black Cat and the Candelai of Palermo, Owner and Founder of Geometrie Naturali Festival and Monumental Event;  in summer he takes refuge in his beloved Pantelleria where he is a resident DJ of Altamarea Club / Kaya Kaya and where he takes care of the soundtrack of the most prestigious parties organised all over the island.

A&R at AWAY Music Berlin. Head Honcho at Haul Music. Releases and remixes on AWAY, Art of Vengeance, Versatile, Global Underground, Perspectiv, Nightime Drama, Get Slow.
A ""New, powerful take on classic Detroit techno"" is how Clone Records described his debut EP Tiger Snake on Ripperton’s label Perspectiv. That was back in 2008 –  already a decade after playing constantly as a live act and DJ in Australia. Drawing on the original sounds from Detroit and Chicago, he forged his own way to present house and techno music downunder. Vance cut his teeth playing with legendary figures of electronic music and it continues to rub off to this day in his adopted home of Berlin. Current projects like “Away Soundsystem” are testament to that.
Career highlights include being invited by Derrick May to collaborate on a remix project for a movie in Carl Craig’s Detroit studio. His collaboration with Discrete Circuit in Berlin on own imprint Away Music was remixed by Joe Claussell and Mr. Ties. (Dixon a big fan of Joe’s dub). 
Bandcamp listed them as one of the labels keeping Berlin Techno fresh and described it as music that “ brims over with rugged machine grooves and serious soul.” The same could be said of Vance’s musical aesthetic as a DJ and live act. He regularly throws down a mixed bag 4+ hour journey at their Berlin parties with guests like Moodymann, Omar S and Move D. His latest project H4L on new sister imprint “Astray” is described by Hardwax as “stomping, direct,
pure, flawless Techno.” Other collaborators and remixers have included Aril Brikha (Art of Vengeance), Kirk Degiorgio (Haul), Etienne Jaumet (Versatile) and his music has appeared on compilations from Carl Cox (Global Underground) and Argy.",2237,433,Christian,Christian Vance,0,2681,user,2019-07-13T17:43:05Z,Vance,615,54,christian-vance,https://soundcloud.com/christian-vance,5,,4,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/2681,soundcloud:users:2681,Christian Vance,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:2681,artist-stations:2681,free,soundcloud:users:2681,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:58810', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000002681-DnZrDB-original.jpg'}]",,False,False,False,

Info:
Dr. Nojoke is a producer, performer and musician– his live sets continually bring new and unique sounds to the table, a combination of field-recordings, self-made sounds, and highly conceptual production that redefine the way we understand electronic music.
A Berlin native and leader in directional minimal techno (or “clikno” as he describes it), Dr. Nojoke is a master of rethinking ordinary musicality and procuring new uses for the everyday.

Dr.Nojoke´s live show may feature instruments such as radio, crushed plastic bottles and souvenirs as Dr.Nojoke celebrates the joy of finding special sounds in everyday objects not usually appreciated for their musicality.

Since 2005 performances in clubs and on festivals in Brazil, South Africa, Canada, Sweden, UK, Italy, Russia, USA, Ukraine, Belarus, Romania, Moldova, Slovenia, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Spain, Portugal, France and throughout Germany.

More than 100 releases (EPs/albums/remixes/contributions) on labels such as CLIKNO, Goldmin Music, Destroy All Monsters, Sleep is Commercial, Klangscheiben, Archipel, UNOIKI, Pluie/Noir, Minim.all, Autist, Eintakt, Resopal ...

She released her debut album 'Heartbeat' on the infamous German label Plastic City in 2012 showing her versatility as an artist and producer, taking the listener on a sophisticated journey through down-tempo soul infused electronic songs, deep house, minimal, tech-house and techno.
With befriended Swedish DJ/producer Cari Lekebusch she initiated a musical project that creates a fine fusion between the darker sounds of Techno and the soulful sweetness of Deep-House. Their 'Good Love Sweet Love' EP on German label Kling Klong, got amazing feedback and reached the Deep-House, Tech-House and Techno charts on Beatport and follow-up EP's 'Crazy' on Monique Musique and 'Fly' on Tulipa Records were played out on festivals by Richie Hawtin and Adam Beyer.

Because of highly rated tracks on the album, it was also sponsored by MTV Networks Baltic.

Brendon grew up in Johannesburg, South Africa. Throughout his childhood and teenage years, he learned piano and drums, finding particular inspiration in the music of artists such as Fela Kuti, My Bloody Valentine, De La Soul and Kraftwerk.

However, it was not until 1993, when Brendon moved to New York City, that his own individual style began to develop. With NYC as his base, he has worked with several prominent labels and collaborated with artists like Mikey Dread, Speedy J, Mutabaruka and MATRiXXMAN.

With dozens of EPs, singles and albums to his name, Brendon’s love for experimenting with sound has created an endless source of inspiration to continuously self-reflect and advance his music. Brendon is consistently striving to reinvent himself and skillfully influence the dub scene in the process.

His musical path began at an early age, first as a self-trained bass player, and later through experimenting with tape recorders and different recording techniques. At this point, his musical perspective was influenced by different artists such as Can, Gentle Giant, The Art Ensemble Of Chicago, Charles Mingus, John Cage, Sonic Youth and Stravinsky. It was in this specific music setting that his sound was formed. Over the years, his sound has been increasingly influenced by electronic music. Artists like Plastikman and Future Sound Of London made a strong impression and influenced him immensely in terms of musical understanding.

Born in families of dancers and musicians, Mathias Freimann and Kai Thurau already as children consequently defeated any trials to get musically nurtured. Thus organ, piano, bass or guitar, which they were teached to play, were estranged from their proper sense and fully used percussively. Since 2007 they understand their musical work as a mission of reducing in position, thereby emphasizing the essence of sound and spreading a feeling of self-frivolous other-wordliness at the same time.

The sound of their performances and productions consists of creating a constant moment of mental, meditative force and orchestral asthetic. Daring, headstrong balance between prosaic and minimal abstraction, dubbed House grooves, rhythmic energy and acoustic finesse result in pulsing, meditative moments with a certain soul.

Apart from releases on Auflegware and Impulse, their first track on Koyo Records will be presented shortly.

Electronic music is more popular than ever, especially TechHouse is on a thriving uprise and Berlin already became the buzzing nightlife capital of the world it is known as today.

Amidst all these creative and musical vibes a new label is born -  Upon.You Records. Founded in February 2007 by DJ & producer Marco Resmann, with a first release under his moniker Phage on Martin Landsky's Intim Recordings as well as great success as one half of the infamous project Luna City Express under his belt, and electronic music veteran Hawks Grunert, formerly involved in running Timing Recordings with Tanith as well as working for legendary „Frontpage“ magazine, Upon.You Records was already widely recognized for its first release, Phage's „Vut & Vat EP“, and started to drive on the fast lane immediately.

Originally intended to be a platform for music from an inner circle of friends as well as for aspiring young talent it didn't take long until the label branched out in 2008 with first international signings,  various label tours all over the place and a first label compilation.

In 2009, after receiving massive support from nightlife heavyweights like Steve Bug, Brothers Vibe, Someone Else and many more, a cover story in German electronic music magazine GROOVE and with a catalogue of roughly twenty 12“ releases Upon.You launched two subdivisions - Upon.You Digital and the momentary Upon.You Sweet & Sour Series – and established a booking agency as well as regular label events at two of Berlin's most praised venues, Watergate Club and the infamous Panoramabar.

Furthermore Upon.You Records teamed up with Workaholics Berlin for the launch of a merchandising line in 2009, introducing the labels unique visual image to the world of street fashion.

With the launch of the annual label retro- / futurespective „Upon.You Diary“ and an expanded core artist family now including Marco Resmann, Martin Landsky, ONNO, Ruede Hagelstein, Gunnar Stiller, Magit Cacoon and The Cheapers alongside many others, 2010 finally paved the way for success and fruitful growth to come in consecutive years in which Upon.You became one of the leading labels in all things TechHouse and related.

And it was even the first issue „Upon.You Diary“ that awed the electronic world with Marco Resmann's widely praised tune „This Song“, immediately ruling every dancefloor after it was released and drawing even more attenttion towards the Berlin-based label which continued to expand its growing international network whilst signing releases by Quenum, Kink or the UK-based longtime ambassador Steve Lawler.

On a jam-packed schedule of about twenty releases per year lately, including Ruede Hagelstein's Beatport smash „Minus“, with label artists touring the globe frequently and armed with the brand new, 2014-launched UYX subdivision focusing on raw TechHouse and classic stamped whitelabel aesthetics, Upon.You has grown into a major force on the international electronic music circuit.

Always on the lookout for new talent and keen to explore new territories, the future looks brighter than ever for Upon.You after entering the longplay circuit with the widely acknowledged album debut of the former Tel Aviv- and now Berlin-based DJ / producer Magit Cacoon, another successful instalment of the „Upon.You Diary“-series and finally entering three digit realms with the release of Marco Resmann's extrordinary gold vinyl 12“  „100“ - the onehundredth Upon.You single release in the label history which was released in late 2015.

And things surely are about to be busier than ever for all members of the Upon.You camp over the course of 2016, celebrating the labels 8th anniversary with a dedicated series of label events all over Europe and special showcases at Sonar / Barcelona as well as ADE and, of course, a string of high quality releases for maximum dancefloor pleasure throughout this season and beyond. Watch out.

Sam K was not brought up in a musical environment. During the first years of his life nobody in his family played much music or even spoke more than necessary. To make things worse just when he turned 10 Sam was struck by lightning on a a boat ride on Lake Leman. Lightly burnt but quite severely shocked he lost the ability to speak for almost 2 years, and it is still unclear whether he could hear properly or not. His deep interest for music began during that period, when his elder brother made him discover house music, by regularly applying a newly acquired boombox on Sam's stomach. Within month Sam regained his speech abilities and came out of the lightning induced haze. But also, a passion for house music was born; he would make his brother tape all the local radio saturday night shows & couldn't get enough music to satisfy his appetite. To this day Sam still applies a speaker on his stomach while listening to music, especially his own productions, making sure the bottom of his tracks is where it should be. 

Co.Founder of the label Perspectiv records with Ripperton, he has been an active DJ on the Swiss musical scene for more than 10 years & has manned the decks in every club or dark basement around. As a producer, his music has found its way on labels such as Dessous Recordings or Peppermint Jam. More recently played by Mano le Tough on Boiler Room his track “Elido” should came out on Connaisseur Records.

Enough said, as you'll have figured out by now Sam K should not to be read or expected to talk much, he just lets his music speak for himself.",932,85,,,0,2755,user,2018-01-11T09:38:11Z,,101,21,sam-k,https://soundcloud.com/sam-k,1,,9,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/2755,soundcloud:users:2755,Sam K,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:2755,artist-stations:2755,free,soundcloud:users:2755,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:142366', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000002755-pkbM72-original.jpg'}]",,False,False,False,

Indeed, in 1998 he met Ali “Dubfire” Shirazinia and Sharam Tayebi and was immediately hired to run some of the dance world's top labels, but he is equally strong as a producer and live performer.

His first remix was released on Yoshitoshi in 1999 and next thing he knew he was opening for Deep Dish at the infamous London underground institution “The End"" (R.I.P.). In 2001 his re-rub of Chris Braan's Ananda Project “Falling For You” (for Nite Grooves/King Street) came out and was picked up by Doc Martin in 2005 for his “Mix The Vibe: Doc Martin - Sublevel Maneuvers” compilation. Chuck often rocked Baltimore MD’s Fever and joined local legends Scott Henry and Charles Feelgood for their finale. He was no stranger to the faithful at Washington, DC super-club Buzz, where he became a much beloved regular.

In 2002, after leaving Yoshitoshi, Chuck devoted his attention to the studio in Washington, DC and with music and event production partner Luis Baro (from XM Radio), he helped to create a series of events entitled “All About.” Notably, Jay J Hernandez, Brett Johnson, Demarkus Lewis, Lavish Habits (live), Lance Desardi, Justin Long as well as Louie Vega and The Elements of Life (live) lent their sounds!  

In 2005 Chuck relocated to Chicago where he ran the boutique distributor GrooveSource controlling the digital catalogs of several of today's top artists and labels. He has also partnered in the legendary Ferox Records with Russ Gabriel and Melodika Recordings with Fabrice Lig and currently runs his own label Prosthetic Pressings along side partner Sean Sanders. Recent work has seen Chuck remix Chicago luminaries Paul Johnson on Dust Traxx and DJ Pierre on his Afro Acid imprint, he has just completed work on Harrison Crump's upcoming album and continues to produce away with full releases on some of today's top techno labels like Perc Trax.

In January of 2010 Chuck relocated back to Washington, DC where he has set up his own company - 2 Cratez Music - and continues to produce as The System Beater with several releases and remixes forthcoming on Prosthetic Pressings and several other labels.

I took my Atari und hooked it up to my cheap ass casio midi-keyboard; as this didn't sound weird enough I put that through a Guitar multi-fx before putting it on a 4track tape. When the .com boom arivved I worked at audioforce.de for a while but soon decided to do something else with my life.. After playing in a few rockbands I discovered my destiny ;-) Dub Music. Echoes and trippy spaces always were my favorite FX, consequently I started researching these a little more with my friend Martin as Crimson Chamber Music. During my Scottish Exile Sunweed Soundsystem from Naples gave me the decisive eduation in Sunny Dub Music which I am eternally grateful for. Back in Jena I listen global and play local, on solo paths I am also looking towards a 4/4 Kickdrum but usually decide to keep things a little weirder than that.",71,60,,,0,2795,user,2009-05-20T21:22:02Z,,1,0,edwin-katzer,https://soundcloud.com/edwin-katzer,0,,2,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/2795,soundcloud:users:2795,Edwin Katzer,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:2795,artist-stations:2795,free,,,,,False,False,False,

In the true adventurous spirit of his Kenbun radio show, Faces Records & MCDE imprint, Pablo Valentino is all about good music period. May it be jazz/hip hop, boogie/disco, house/broken beats...but always trying to explode and explore the boundaries between all creating patterns past, present and future.

FACES Records also own its subdivision MCDE Recordings run by both Danilo Plessow (Motor City Drum Ensemble) & Pablo Valentino (Faces Records).

MCDE is focussing on house and techno sounds - sophisticated, emotional tracks which stand on their own and also have a certain longevity. The goal is to bring some emotions back to the dancefloor, cause whats a party without a feeling?

Kerri Chandler once summed it up brillantly :
A basement, a red light & a feeling.

CORD LABUHN [Robosonic | Outtakes | Punchi] 

Cartoon life - At six years old, CORD LABUHN had his first real career aspiration : becoming an ‘inventor’. Or space traveller. At least working in some kind of laboratory. Hence he became a producer of beats, tunes, records, imagery & merch - and toured the whole planet to play music for the most spaced out...
Earlier, when the ghost of Jimi Hendrix jumped out of his parents record collection and passionately promoted the guitar as the weapon of choice for a leftist punk, folk, if not eurodance infected teenager of the 90s, the piano and his sister’s drumset would have to step back for a while. 

A few years later when TV was still the thing and gaming consoles like PS1 were battling N64, Cord the Beatmaker was rather staring at tiny AKAI S2000, MPC and CRT displays, head-nodding, turning the jogwheels, dreaming of a second turntable to complete his DJ setup - the true school, golden age hiphop way. Next mission - still as a school kid - was a self-released vinyl record with international distribution through a self-founded label – learning everything from scratch, only a few years before DJing went 99,9% digital, crazy fast and globalised anyway. 
Arriving in Berlin and founding the mashup label „BROKEN BOOTLEGS“ (with Exploited’s Shir Khan and Andy Szankay) was good sparring for more delinquent ventures in professional sampling culture. Musical diversion had found an anarchic playground, genre-bending seemed to be a welcome concept for a radical open mind.

To date, his longest running project is ROBOSONIC, which was originally formed as a DJ-producer duo together with Sacha Robotti more than 10 years ago. Over the course of time it became Cords solo moniker in the dance music game, since his former partner had emigrated to the US for a fresh personal start. 
A while after the unconventional, free-spirited debut album „Sturm und Drang“ (2007) Robosonic took the world by storm with a string of popular tunes and remixes that went into the crates of tens of thousands of DJs worldwide and made it to top spots in the infamous Beatport charts (“Worst Love”, “The Edge” 2012, “La Fique” 2013, “House Music” 2015, “Rise” 2016). With releases on labels like Defected, Toolroom, Get Physical, Diynamic, Stil vor Talent, Deep Dish’s Yoshitoshi, Nervous, Crew Love, Kittball or Mother Recordings, ROBOSONIC became an authentic figurehead for something dubbed “Golden Era House” (Juice Magazine). Not only because Cord was convincing real rap icons like Masta Ace, Jeru the Damaja and KRS-One to collaborate on house tracks, but also because ROBOSONIC remixed true legends like Todd Terry, Arthur Baker, Kerri Chandler and Eddie Amador.
The house & techno driven sets and records under the R°° flag are internationally recognised and performances in 45+ countries (and counting) reflect the universal appeal of a trademark sound Robosonic unleashed into the world. North & South America, most European countries, South East Asia, China and Russia, Egypt down to South Africa, Dubai to Australia, Lebanon and Israel. Cord Labuhn has seen and pleased hundreds of stages, clubs and crowds over the last years. And with the string of new Robosonic releases through Defected, Kittball, Mother Recordings and more it becomes clear that he won’t stop shedding club sweat and tears.",63345,1457,Cord,Cord Labuhn,0,2832,user,2021-07-08T22:12:34Z,Labuhn,291,27,robosonic,https://soundcloud.com/robosonic,21,,152,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/2832,soundcloud:users:2832,ROBOSONIC,True,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:2832,artist-stations:2832,creator-pro-unlimited,soundcloud:users:2832,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:124824594', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000002832-mWfpAQ-original.jpg'}]",,False,True,True,

T-Ash is an Italian DJ from Umbria, with a genuine passion for a wide range of music. One of his main strengths is the ability to mix many different sounds and genres together, from a mediterranean prospective, contaminated with House, Jazz, Soul, Balearic, to a more electronic sensibility merged with world music and other alternative styles.
Thomas started his career playing house music in his home town, with iconic DJs such as Tony Humphries, Jovonn, Franck Roger and Kenny Carpenter to name a few. Progressing from there, he had the opportunity to play in other major Cities around the world, clubs such as Tenax (Florence), Egg (London), Pacha (London), Winter Music Conference (Miami) and many others.

His name has circulated around the island house scene for over 10 years so Luca belongs to the artists’ generation who gives the best contribution to the italian club culture in the early 90 and makes Catania, his hometown, the major centre in Sicily. 
Turning his hand to a variety of styles while still maintaining a strong signature sound, Luca has created an admired musical identity and a loyal global following.
House, techno, funk and deep define his background, which then pours into his sets, which cannot be labeled in any one style of music, demonstrating that Luca is a versatile and ecletic artist, those who have a different story to tell, from time to time.
He’s a very talented artist, able to rig in any situation.
His performances are really great shows, that always manage to surprise his audience. People often come under the console imploring him to play another tune. Nobody wants to go back home when he plays.

Between 2007 and 2009 Luca edited a radio program, Electronic Pleasure, in the famous 'Succo d'House' on Radio SIS. He is writing for DJ Mag Italy also.
But his first love is playing records.
Since 1999 he is a resident of AFC (Atmosphere). AFC has hosted the best international djs for years, at whose side Luca has regularly played and exchanged ideas and music. At one of these parties he met Larsen. A perfect union, born almost as a game in 2004, after a b2b improvised at the Taitù, cult and underground club of the Sicilian house scene in those years. The unexpected feeling lead them to go steady, both in djing then in the producing music. Together with his half, Luca realesed in 2007 ""A18/Deviazioni"" for the Ocean Dark, a debut that brought a breath of fresh air to the music scene that year.

Paolo Martini immediately recognized his talent, so decided to recruit him in the Ocean Dark, for which they produced ""The Dark Side Of The Rhum"" in 2008 and ""Dirty thingz"" in 2009. Luca gained the European scene and world record with several releases and remixes for Off, Tenax Recordings, Paul’s Boutique, Zoo:Technique , Niveous supported by djs like Richie Hawtin, Carl Cox, Pete Tong, Josh Wink, Dj Sneak, Reboot, Karotte, Joris Voorn, Jamie Jones, Tania Vulcano, Federico Molinari, Markus Fix, Robert Dietz, Lauhaus, Technasia and many more.

Luca stands out among the artists of national and international house scene, with dj sets @ Weekend, Tresor (Berlin), Zoo Project (Ibiza), Echoes (Riccione), Tenax (Florence), Magazzini Generali (Milan), Kudos (Mamaia-RO), Culture Box (Copenaghen), Flex (Wien), The End, The Egg and Aquarium (London), Sensi Bar (Chisinau-MD), Spazio 900 (Rome), Alter Ego (Verona).
Since 2010, with Paolo Martini, he’s also one of the minds of Paul's Boutique, in the role of A&R and label manager, as well as a producer. His remix of ""It's You"",and tracks like ""Oh Set Me Free"", ""I'll House U"", ""Mediterraneano"" , “Dreams Come True” and “Don’t Stop” are among the most supported and sold tracks of the entire Paul's Boutique’ catalog.
At the beginning of 2012 Luca started working in the studio with the young and talented Allen, with whom he will sign releases for labels such as Viva Music LTD, Paul's Boutique, Zoo: Technique, Catwash Records and These Days Records.
Another point to note is the track ""Supaground"" produced by the Romanian Escapism Musique entry and remained in the Top 100 Beatport House for several weeks and considered one of the best tracks of 2012 by Roger Sanchez.
From 2013 Luca, with Francesco Testa, creates to a series of party projects: L’Aperidisko, first a little Wednesday-party-friends, then a party which features artists from the underground scene; Fire, an innovative party with a selective sound, which explodes in a spectacular stage at One Day Music, the biggest 1th May Festival in Catania; RedHead, which realizes a wonderful party at Castello di Calatabiano with Dj Tennis",2617,9,Luca,Luca Marano,0,2876,user,2021-09-26T09:24:46Z,Marano,136,6,luca-marano,https://soundcloud.com/luca-marano,5,,2,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/2876,soundcloud:users:2876,Luca Marano,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:2876,artist-stations:2876,free,soundcloud:users:2876,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:6126983', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000002876-ekPhc0-original.jpg'}]",,False,False,False,

A serious collector & selector with an expansive record archive that has both depth and breadth across the many genres .

With a deep passion for the finest underground dance music his aim is always to free your mind , move your body and elevate your soul . Effortlessly straddling yesterday’s forgotten gems and tomorrow’s classics with one foot in the past and one foot in the future. Always at the cutting edge and never repeating himself with his fluent improvised flow.

Also an honorary resident at Glastonbury festival with Block9's kaleidoscopic fun house NYC Downlow which Tristan sights as a 'strobelit utopia' and one of his favourite places on the planet.  Regularly turning it out at some of the finest rave meccas across the planet by himself or with his dynamite Dungeon Meat project alongside Brawther, it’s easy to see why his contribution to the dance floor has seen him span nearly 2 decades and continue to win fans everywhere he goes.

Born in Munich, Calvin Bosco is not a new face in Germanys growing scene of electronic DJs. He made his first steps in 1994, playing Trance Music mainly, before he get his tabs on UK Garage and Underground House in 1996. At this time he is already playing at some of Munich’s hottest clubs.

With his move to Berlin in 1997, it didn't take long before he became one of Germany's Elite behind the decks. Playing at some of Europe's top addresses for House Music like the 90° or WMF as well as underground-hotspots like the Cookies makes him one of Germanys Breakthrough Artists in his scene. Together with DJs like Alan Sommerville, Sebastian Krieg or Phonique, he is responsible for some of the most memorable Parties in the german capitol.

In the beginning of the new millennium, Calvin Bosco finally became the host of his own weekly radio show on the famous pirate station „Twen FM“. Not only is this a huge boost to his confidence, but also it opens the door to residencies at the Sage Club or his own underground partylabel „stylomat“. 

From 2007 to 2010 he played at the Maxxim Club, Berlins new reference when it comes to House, on a regular basis. Alongside DJs like Fedde le Grand, Axwell, Judge Jules, Tom Novy, DJ Chuckie, Eddie Thoneick, Armand van Helden, Bob Sinclair , Lenny Fontana, Eddie Amador or Tony Humphries, he really brought fire to the dancefloor.
Besides his regular gigs in Berlin, Calvin Bosco featured at nearly every important house event in the past years. „MTV Designerama“, „Smirnoff Experience“, VIVAs TV show „Are u hot“ and of course the „Loveparade“ - Calvin Bosco was there!

In 2008, his groovy oldschool remix for „Wait 4 U“, originally produced by New York’s House legend Lenny Fontana (Powerhouse), brought him international attention and was released over Ministry of Sound Germany / Caus-N-Effect.
The record was licensed to Italy and the UK (Ministry of Sound UK) and was the last step stone on his way to become one of Germanys new talents when it comes to producing.  

2009 was the year to bring his career to another level! With the song „The Chase“ together with his producing partner Chris Bekker, he brought the same titled Giorgio Moroder theme (Academy Award winning soundtrack from the movie „Midnight Express“) back to life.  The song was already played, amongst others, by DJ legends like Junior Sanchez (Miami), while some of worlds most popular DJs like Lenny Fontana, Todd Terry and D.O.N.S. are contributing exclusive remixes for the release and reached the top ten in several Dance Charts all over Europe in 2009 (DDC # 5, Ibiza Club Charts # 5, Swiss DJ-Charts # 7).

In 2014 he played with his, new Deep House Project JAY'n'FOX, which he has founded together with DJane Jacqeline Sensuelle from Vienna, among other things, the KaterHolzig closing, Ritter Butzke Chalet Club, Trust Bar, Arena Club, Bread & Butter. Moreover Inside, the most successful club in south-east Germany, committed Calvin Bosco for an exclusive residency.

In June 2015 Calvin Bosco had the big honor to represent Berlin as the official music ambassador for Berlin Partner during the „Berlin Week“ at the German Pavillon at Expo Milano 2015. His daily stage appearances beside weel-known bands were a big success. Further new collaborations with friendly DJs as well as first requests for Remixes are in the line and the first own productions are planned. To be continued...

extraordinary talent on synthesizers and other electronic devices.

In Heron’s case, things are different. Because Martin Spittel has been shaped musically since his childhood, the influences were as diverse as music can be.

On one side, there was his grandfather, who played various instruments, and to whom young Martin related closest to and whose influence still lasts until today. On the other side there were his cousins who were not much older than himself, enthusiastic about AC/DC, and band members themselves. Over the course of the following years, he explored the diversity of Black, Death and Trash Metal, EBM and Industrial, right up to Detroit Techno.

Ever since then, Heron's environment served as compensation to ferce parties and expanding his musical horizon. This symbiosis from the love of nature and the musical influences from his early childhood are a direct reflection of Heron’s entire life.

Following the scream of the waders (limicoline birds), he moved to picturesque island Norderney in 2003. There, exploring the island’s national park, he decided to live up to his enthusiasm about nature by going to study landscape ecology at the University of Münster. It turned out: The relocation to Münster was the initial spark for his career; the months in Norderney were inspiration for the name of his label “Limikola” which was founded in late 2008 and enjoyed enormous support by both DJs and fans.

After launching his now very successful °Schaltkreis-parties with four friends in mid-2007, everything went quickly: His first own radio show “The Grasshopper Warbler”, contacts to prominent players like Someone Else and Heartthrob, and finally the moment in early 2008 during the season’s opening at Time Warp, when Richie Hawtin played all three tracks from Heron’s Retro EP. It was merely his second EP, released on a netlabel (Minisome), and it became immediately successful. A knightly accolade.

The journey that Heron started lead to his bombshell track “Welcome to the Adventure Club” that charted in the Beatport charts in 2008, and continued with remixes and releases for Synewave, Supdub, Swap, micro.fon, Prosthetic Pressings and Sleaze Records. In 2010, it culminated with a tour across North America during the summer.

Two years later he released his very first EP on the legendary Detroit label KMS Records, owned by Kevin Saunderson, followed by remixes for Drumcomplex, P-Ben and Chris Gekä, one collaboration project with Inner City's Ann Saunderson and his second solo release „Ride The Pride“. Furthermore he made the step into the Soma family by publishing three solo EPs and an EP with Kevin's son Dantiez Saunderson, as well as he started to release on Florian Meindl's FLASH Recordings.

Jeff dove into club music early in his life, socializing with ideas and tastes from a broad and diverse range of sources: from New Wave, Electro, Techno to Hip Hop, along with artists and producers like Kanye West, Dj Hell, Mike Dean and Sven Vath, bumping his buzz up and building his own wave.

Eveline’s touch sounds instantly dramatic, riding on sultry grooves, grainy effects, indistinct vocals, exotic drum fills, dark and narcotic melodies which converge for a storyboard full of character and colors. 
This engaging approach has brought him to the attention of worldwide DJ star Sam Paganini, and the stuff resulted from this partnership had enthusiastic feedbacks by DJ-Mag USA.",1106,2,,,0,2945,user,2022-02-11T15:52:07Z,,26,3,jeffeveline,https://soundcloud.com/jeffeveline,2,,13,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/2945,soundcloud:users:2945,Jeff Eveline,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:2945,artist-stations:2945,creator-pro-unlimited,soundcloud:users:2945,True,"[{'urn': 'soundcloud:visuals:51043041', 'entry_time': 0, 'visual_url': 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000002945-zY9t8N-original.jpg'}]",,False,True,False,

His genre-bending sets are said to have one of the most impressive playlists, garnering respect and admiration from his peers. 
 
“Good music is simply good music. I refuse to be pigeon-holed and the crowd shouldn’t be either!” 
 
This personal philosophy and love for quality music has led him to co-founding the quartet MUGIC, infamous for their parties at the now defunct Night and Day Bar and now spreading their musical vibes at The Observatory in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Together with MUGIC, Ulysses has also been featured at various top notch venues around the island including the Gilles Peterson Worldwide Music Festival. He's also been made a regular feature for Singapore's leading party promoter THE COUNCIL SG having played for their pop up parties and also THE HEADQUARTERS which is one of the few leading underground clubs in Singapore's nightlife.
 
When not hosting MUGIC parties, Ulysses has also featured at street parties and held club / bar residencies playing alongside some of Singapore's finest tastemakers and luminaries from the world over such as Jerome Syndenham,  Francois K, Deetron, Todd Terje, Jus-Ed, Kay Suzuki, Jonathan Kusuma, Tony Lionni, Nick Hoppner, Eric Duncan, Jimpster, Borrowed Identity, Gerd Janson and A Guy Called Gerald to name a few. He has also been invited twice to perform on Lush 99.5FM’s “Clubscape with Chris Ho”. Ulysses also currently serves as the Music Consultant for POTATO HEAD SINGAPORE, a role that sees him curating and overseeing the music direction of it's bar and restaurant.
 
Whether he is easing the dance floor into a trancey and hypnotic vibe with the dark sounds of techno, or lifting them up with pumping house, he knows how to rock a party and one should expect nothing less than quality sounds from Ulysses.

He is Brooklyn's bang mixed with Mid-Western politeness, and is easily one of the most original and well-liked artists in the industry. His sought-after Live PA, matched with a discography and release schedule that aspiring artists would kill for, keeps him consistently in high demand. He has turned up the heat in recent years, burning miles across the globe and sharing his enthusiasm for music and life via Macbook, Machinedrum and two Korg's.

Tony's lengthy journey from a College scratch DJ in Effingham, IL, to Brooklyn live artist and International superstar has been driven by his love and fascination for innovative musical ideas. His range of inspiration fuels his indefinable sound, gathering ideas through early Hip-Hop, House, Industrial and finally Techno. Channeling these expressions through his performances has earned him center stage at places like I Love Techno, Nature One, Awakenings, Tresor, Berghain, Chris Liebing's Spinclub, Kozzmozz, Fuse, and even the closing of the famous La Real in Spain.

In 2005 Tony met Tim Xavier and Camea in Brooklyn, and they began releasing together on Clink Recordings. He has contributed to five of their releases as a solo artist, and collaboratively with Tim as the Afternoon Coffee Boys. He ignited the label's popularity with his biggest record of 2007, Kreuzberg Krunk. Tony also works with Alexi Delano, Dietrich Schoenemann and Dave Shokh (Dirka Dirka) on numerous projects and his work has been featured on top labels such as Cocoon, Weave, Podium and Frankie Records.

With additional plans for work under the Afternoon Coffee Boys moniker, coupled with his numerous collaborative releases on other labels such as Plus 8 with Alexi Delano, Tony is placing himself in the center of the action. With the rising popularity of Live PAs, Tony's experience, production and performance skills have set him above the rest, and he is considered to be one of the hottest techno acts coming out of America today.",7859,8,Tony,Tony Rohr,0,2984,user,2018-10-26T18:13:54Z,Rohr,10,0,tonyrohr,https://soundcloud.com/tonyrohr,17,,55,https://api.soundcloud.com/users/2984,soundcloud:users:2984,tonyrohr,False,soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:2984,artist-stations:2984,free,,,,,False,False,False,

Gern kann man rätseln wofür das Kürzel PK45 steht, wofür jedoch sein Name steht, daran lässt er keine Luft: für technoiden Sound mit Herzschrittmacher-Bass, intelligenten Rhythmen und eindringlichen Melodien. Sozusagen eine tonale Symbiose aus Electronica, Dubstep und UK Funky mit der Eigenschaft leidenschaftlich, dreckig und extrem tanzbar zu sein.

PK45 hält nichts von Vorspiel und kommt so schnell auf den Punkt, wie Platz zwischen Tapete und Wand ist. Man will nicht tanzen, man muss.

Als gebürtiger Plauener gehört er zu einer neuen Generation jener die an den 1210ern feilen ohne dabei nur DJ` sein zu wollen.

But don't typecast him as a one-dimensional droid with a M-nus Records logo tattoo. He's been exploring the upper echelons of the techno/house continuum since the early '90s (including the last 10 years at The Top, a weekly event hosted by S.W.A.T., aka Special Weapons and Tactics), gaining a reputation as a DJ's DJ, with acclaim coming from house-music legends like Derrick Carter and Doc Martin. Moreover, Baytala's list of musical influences and loves is vast, eclectic, and impeccable. The following roll call just scratches the surface: dub/reggae (Lee ""Scratch"" Perry), jazz (Pharoah Sanders), world (Ravi Shankar, Mulatu Astatke), funk (Cymande), soul (Bill Withers), hiphop (Gang Starr), Krautrock (Can), electro (Egyptian Lover, Kraftwerk), disco (DJ Harvey), Latin (Tito Puente), soundtrack/new age (Vangelis), rock (Steely Dan), post-punk (ESG, Liquid Liquid), and post-rock (Outhud). As for his bread and butter, Baytala similarly displays excellent judgment, with a heavy preference for quality-pushers like Jeff Mills, Gas, Monolake, Robert Hood, Theo Parrish, and Mr. Fingers. When you see a DJ possess such wide-ranging, outstanding taste, it instills confidence that he/she will rarely, if ever, veer into wackness. Baytala clearly has put many hours of study into his craft, and it's paid off with smooth mixes and world-class track selection. Besides his formidable technical skills and profound knowledge, Baytala reportedly exudes a lot of personality and passion behind the decks, which must have served him well while opening for acts like Jane's Addiction. Everything I've heard by Baytala suggests that his sets avoid the supposed pitfalls of minimal dance music. They're kinetic and dynamic.

************************************************************************

Max Essa has been active as a DJ and producer since the early 90s, initially releasing music on labels including Warp Records and Paperecordings and DJing alongside the infamous D.i.Y Sound System.

His later work, for labels like Is It Balearic? Recordings, went on to be play-listed by legends such as Andrew Weatherall and David Mancuso, gaining him a devoted following and DJ bookings around the world. 

Albums for the Japanese major label, Victor Entertainment ('Vacations Never Taken' 2015) and Music For Dreams ('Lanterns' 2018), plus EPs for the Italian label, Hell Yeah! Recordings and a constant stream of remixes, have shown him to be a deeply imaginative and prolific producer.

For the past decade Max has held two DJ residencies in Tokyo, Lone Star at the legendary, Bar Bonobo with Ken Hidaka and Dr Rob (Ban Ban Ton Ton) and Fridays at the ever-popular Aoyama Tunnel. He also plays regularly at clubs and events all over Japan, from Hokkaido to Okinawa. He has been very busy in the studio throughout 2021 and has a string of releases lined up for 2022.

From Paris, France, Mancini has always been attracted by music. First inspired by Rock, he started playing guitar in a band, and then slowly discovered electronic music at the end of the 90's. The idea of playing his own music selection and making people dance was dangerously growing in his mind! In 2001, a meeting on a beach will convince him to buy his turntables. Through the years, his style matured. Gimmick, sensibility but mostly rhythms define the best his House music vision! His dj sets are a spontaneous mixture of grooves fuelled by his crowd’s reaction. He has played alongside famous djs as Jamie Jones, Dyed Soundorom, Miss Kittin, Archie Hamilton, iO Mulen, Cab Drivers, Diego Krause, Robert Owens, Losoul... In september 2016, in a desire of pure freedom, he decided to launch his own vinyl label simply named “Mancini”. Handstamped and limited releases, its have reached the first places on the vinyls charts of Deejay, Decks shops several times and been played by the likes of Apollonia, Enzo Siragusa, Archie Hamilton, Seb Zito, Ferro, Djebali, Chris Carrier... He is now managing and promoting with Wlad the vinyl and digital label hedZup records, that is knowing a great ascension in the Minimal House world.

Downtown Party Network might once have been a short yet magical period of New York City nightlife. Today the name stands for music from another side of the world - Lithuania. An entity combined of experiences, influences, events, trips, and adventures in music that have come together during the last 20 years.

Downtown Party Network’s music has been signed by german Get Physical Music and Dirt Crew Recordings, british Futureboogie and Anjunadeep, belgian Eskimo Recordings and australian Future Classic to name a few. The releases have been favorited by DJ Harvey, Dixon, Laurent Garnier, Groove Armada, Tensnake, Ame, Jamie Jones, Sasha.

‘Days Like These’ by Downtown Party Network released on legendary Eskimo Recordings back in 2009 became a dancefloor destroyer, hitting record shops’ charts and being played by countless amount of djs all around the world.

‘Space Me Out’, released in October 2013 by Silence Music, became one of the most charted tracks on Resident Advisor in 2013. Mario Basanov, Hannes Fischer and Musk accompanied the original track with brilliant remixes. Each of them received a significant amount of attention, as well as a melodramatic music video that was filmed in spooky Lithuanian nature. A year later, a new version of ‘Space Me Out’ was revamped and presented exclusively on ‘Deep House Amsterdam’ just before Amsterdam Dance Event and a brand new remix of the worldwide hit, crafted by the legendary producer Ewan Pearson. 

In the last years DPN had his shows in New York, San Fransisco, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sydney, Shanghai, Singapore, Dubai, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Bangkok, Seoul, Mexico City, Jakarta, London, Berlin, Bali,  Bucharest, Ho Chi Minh, Moscow, etc.
